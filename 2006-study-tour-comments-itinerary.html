<p>This study tour was offered as 3-unit course to the students. There were
33 students, faculty, retired faculty and community members in the study tour.
It was co-directed by Professor Joan Sharma and Brijesh Sharma.</p>
<br>
<p>"I don't know how to thank you for organizing and managing the travel study. I know it was labor of love and took many many hours of your time. But I am sure it went a long way to increase the participants understanding and appreciation of the world.”</p>
<p><b>- Dr. Vida Samiian, Dean, College of Arts and Humanities, California State University, Fresno, CA</b></p>
<br>
<h2>Comments of participants</h2>
<p>“This was my very first visit to India. It was an absolutely fantastic experience! I was with a wonderful group of both
students and educators that made the tour such a fascinating learning experience. The first moment I saw the Taj Mahal
through the East Gate, it took my breath away. Touring Fatehpur Sikri and Tomb of Salim Chrishti still resonate in my
mind. I loved learning about the layers and mix of both Hindu and Mughal architectural styles. Brij made sure that every
detail of the tour from meals to transportation to special events were all managed meticulously.”</p>
<p><b>- Sky Sweet</b></p>
<p>As I look over our photos, I’m reminded of the diverse two weeks we had in India. Thanks to you both for making it all possible. The visits to the gardens and museums; the walks around the historic sites; and the nights at wonderful heritage hotels. Also you had us sample the various ways of getting around – bus, boat, jeep, train, elephant, and (by far the most fun) Ox Cart! Each day was filled with something new to see and learn. Thank you again for the memorable, incredible India Tour.</p>
<p><b>- Mary F. M. & Paul O.</b></p>
<p>India was fantastic! I want to thank you both, and Mukul, for making this a memorable life experience. You three make quite a team and add to that Dara (the bus driver) and Kalu (bus driver’s assistant). I doubt that more than a few people would have seen and done as much as we did in so short a time. Brij, your love for India was palpable. I appreciate your and Joan’s efforts for making India alive for me. The Taj Mahal Hotel in Delhi exceeded my expectations. After Taj Mahal Hotel, my second favourite hotel was Deogarh Palace. I loved meeting the owners and the intricate maze of passageways, the views and the general ambience. A highlight for me: horseback riding with Joan, out in the countryside and through small village near Devgarh that was special.</p>
<p><b>- Kaye B. C.</b></p>
<p>The reception at the airport on arrival in New Delhi was very nice – we were met by Mukul and each of us presented with a long stemmed rose. The air-conditioned coach driver was excellent and several times had a cheering ovation. His assistant was also more than helpful. The Taj Mahal Hotel in New Delhi was quite the most luxurious hotel in which I have ever stayed. What a treat for two nights! All local guides were knowledgeable – an asset and valuable part of the tour. Our visit to India was an incredible and awesome experience. India is quite the most intriguing country I have ever visited. To start with I would like say that the tour was wonderful and far exceeded my expectations. I do want to thank you so much for all the thought and effort that was put into it to make it such a memorable experience for all of us.</p>
<p><b>- Diana K.</b></p>
<p>The reception at the airport on arrival in New Delhi was excellent. Mukul met us and had every thing. The coach driver was excellent and the coach was comfortable. The Taj Mahal Hotel in Delhi exceeded my expectation. Everything was fabulous – the accommodation, service and facility. Deogarh Palace – great sense of history permeates the facility. It was a real treat to have a sit down lunch (outstanding meal) at the Lake Palace Hotel in Udaipur. Enjoyed the cultural performance very much, especially the dance troop at the Zoroastrian Fire Temple and Dr. Sharma, the Sitar/Music teacher and her troop (guitar, drummer and the small sitar). All guides met our expectations. Would say that Devinder in Jaipur (Amber Palace Tour) was outstanding. I enjoyed the visit to India immensely and would recommend to my friends, would consider visiting another region of India.</p>

<p>At the airport we were directed to the coach, which was easily identified and boarded with assistance as needed. The driver and coach were excellent. The Taj Mahal Hotel in New Delhi was excellent; in fact it exceeded our expectations. Deogarh Palace was fascinating; I enjoyed walking down the village streets. The India study tour was certainly very educational. It makes one realize how others live. There are certainly many levels of hospitality in India and the country needs to help its poorer citizens.</p>

<p>The driver was great, very nice and the service was A+ and the bus was good. What can you say about the “Taj Mahal Hotel” in Delhi – the place is beautiful – I could have stayed all week there!! The meals at restaurants were great, enjoyed the restaurants and the service! I enjoyed the India Study Tour very much!! Would have liked to spend more time in each hotel.</p>

<p>I will always have wonderful memories of India because of you. Thank you for showing me a new culture and a better understanding for my Indian students in my art classes. The Taj Mahal Hotel in Delhi exceeded my expectations. I loved the Devgarh Palace Hotel the best. All meals were delicious and the service was great. My most memorable experience e in India was the journey to Amber Fort. We had taken planes, trains, busses, taxis, boats and oxen driven carts to get to and around India. But in Amber, we sat tall on platforms on top of elephant’s backs. Swaying from side to side, the strength and massiveness of these animals was felt with every step. Gently and quietly these large animals ascended to the Amber Fort and I, for one, felt humbled by their grace. India is place that I will remember, however, for its heart. I was thrilled to see the Taj Mahal for its architectural design but more amazed that this building was not a palace but a mausoleum for one person, the emperor’s queen. This is a real love story. It was worth waiting to see it and appreciate its lore. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to India. I would consider another region. All in all, the trip was more than I expected – it was incredible. Thank you.</p>

<p>We felt welcomed in India on arrival at airport in New Delhi. The bus driver was great. The Taj Mahal Hotel in New Delhi was memorable. Hotel Carlson in Jaipur was excellent. With the meals in restaurants we got a good taste of India. The musical entertainment was fun. Each guide was familiar with their area. It was a great, well organized.</p>

<p>In many ways Chaturmukh, the four-faced Jain temple at Ranakpur in the Aravali Mountains, was the high point of the whole trip. Though there were many foreign tourists present, it seemed to be a real living temple. There were limits on the tourists. A distinction was being made between the general architecture and statuary (which we could take pictures of) and the sacred idols (which we could not). Also there seemed to be ordinary Jains coming in to make small offerings and perform ceremonies. Our guide was a 17th. Generation priest of the place. If I remember correctly, the temple was founded in the 1400s. Could this be the original family of priests? After relating some of the history and some of the meanings of the sculptures, he gave us all a blessing, and then his uncle chanted prayers for our safe return. There were one or two other men wearing the orange and red clothes of the priests who sat meditating beside some of the thousand pillars. The interior was like a forest with multiple levels and canopies and different entrances for the light. ....... Another prominent place of religious activity is the dashboards. Buses, cars and 3-wheelers are all equipped with miniature shrines for fervent prayer. Our Sikh bus-driver was no exception, keeping pictures of gurus up front, and saying a quick twilight prayer while driving through mountains. Driving in India seems to be fundamentally different than driving in America. Luck is more important than law; the horn is more important than the steering wheel. After all, when your bus is on the wrong side of the road passing another bus, with a third bus head-on, your steering wheel only controls your vehicle; the horn encourages the other two (or three) to move. Luck should be obvious. The relationship of luck to shrines is beyond the scope of this paper.</p>
