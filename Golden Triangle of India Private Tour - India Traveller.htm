<p>After breakfast sightseeing of Qutub Minar: its construction was 
initiated by Qutubudin-Aibak in 1198 CE upon becoming the first Sultan 
of Delhi.</p>
<p>Qubub Uddin Aibak was born in Turkestan of ethnic Mamluk descent. 
This was a region where youth went out to neighboring countries and 
joined their armies as mercenaries. Often they were enslaved when the 
army they were fighting with lost. Qutubuddin was sold to the Qazi 
(Islamic judge) of Nishapur in Persia. There he became favorite of his 
master because of his skills of horseriding and archery among other 
warrior abilities. Qazi’s sons were jealous and they sold him after the 
Qazi’s death. Finally he ended up as slave of Sultan Muhammad of Ghur 
province of Afghanistan. He led Sultan of Ghur’s army in the 1st and 2nd
 battle of Tarain and was appointed Governor of Lalkot, the capital of 
the last Hindu Chauhan dynasty kingdom. When Muhammad of Ghur was 
assassinated, Qutubuddin bin Aibak declared himself sovereign monarch 
and started the construction of Qutub Jami Mosque (a.k.a. Quwwat ul 
Islam Mosque) and Qutub Minar. The construction of minaret did not 
complete in his lifetime and many later Islamic rulers of various 
successive dynasties left their mark on this monument, which is now 5 
stories high and 73 meters or 240 feet tall. The mosque was constructed 
using architectural elements of 27 Hindu and Jain temples that were 
demolished to build it. Much of the decorative pillars and facades of 
walls in the mosque were used without alteration in the new mosque, only
 the Arabic verses from the Quran were added new, sculpted by Hindu 
artisans who did not know the Arabic language and curved the endings of 
letters as they did with Sanskrit language carvings. Qutub Minar is a 
UNESCO World Heritage Site. </p>

<p>Later sightseeing of the Second Mughal Emperor Humayun's Tomb - its 
architecture may have influenced the construction of the Taj Mahal in 
Agra. Emperor Humayun died just six months after winning the throne of 
Delhi in 1556 CE. His widow, Hamida Bano Begum (a.k.a. Haji Begum) 
supervised its construction under Mughal Emperor Akbar’s rule. Having 
recently returned from Persia and its architect, Mirak Mirza Ghiyath, 
being a Persian, the monuments has elements of Persian and Hindu 
architecture blended in it. Many later Mughal rulers are also buried in 
this mausoleum. Humayun’s Tomb is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. </p>
<p>Proceed further for sightseeing of India Gate (the war memorial), 
Parliament House and Presidents House (from outside) and for lunch at 
Gulati’s Restaurant in Khan Market nearby. The British decided in 1911 
to move their capital from Calcutta (now Kolkata) to Delhi. Edwin 
Landseer Lutyens and his friend Herbert Baker were chosen for designing 
various buildings in the new capital. In 1914 the First World War 
started and continued until 1918. During this period the new capital’s 
construction was halted. Finally after its construction completed, the 
British capital was moved to New Delhi in 1931. India Gate was 
originally a monument to honor the fallen Indian soldiers in World War 
I, but now honors Indian soldiers all subsequent wars. </p>
<p>In the afternoon stop by the Red Fort for photography from outside - 
the massive sandstone fort built by Shah Jahan on the banks of river 
Yamuna. The fifth Mughal Emperor Shahjahan moved his capital from Agra 
to Delhi in 1636 and started the construction of the walled 
“Shahjahanabad” city with 14 gates. The most important gates, Mori, 
Lahori, Ajmeri, Turkman, Kashmiri and Delhi Gates still exist along with
 remnants of the wall. Within the city there were many monuments 
constructed but the most ambitious project was the Red Fort – according 
to a horoscope done to determine the auspicious time for starting its 
construction, the work on building the Red Fort started on May 12, 1639.
 In the Emperor’s Balcony in Diwan-i-Am or the Hall of Public Audience, 
there are a set of marble panels that were made in Pietra Dure art by 
the Florentine jeweler, Austin de Bordeaux. The most famous of these is 
the one depicting Orpheus playing the flute. There are many other 
palaces in the fort that were decorated with inlay of semi-precious 
stones in marble. Red Fort is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>

<p><b>Jama Masjid -</b> is the largest mosque in India and stands across
 the road from the Red Fort, built by Mughal Emperor Shahjahan 1650-56 
CE. It was originally called "Masjid-i-Jahannuma" or world reflecting 
mosque. Its construction was supervised by Vazir Saadula Khan and its 
chief architect was Ustad Khalil. About 25,000 people can pray here at a
 time. Overnight stay in hotel in New Delhi.</p>
<h3 class="headingtxt">Day 3 // DELHI - AGRA (165 Kilometers or 103 miles in 2 hours):  </h3>
<p>After breakfast transfer to Agra on the Yamuna Expressway and on 
arriving stop at the Tomb of Itmad-ud-Daulah. This is the mausoleum 
built under supervision of Empress Nurjahan for her parents, Mirza Ghiaz
 Beg and Begum Asmat in 1628 CE almost 7 years after her father's death.
 Mirza Ghiaz Beg received the title of Itmad-ud-Daulah or ‘Lord of 
Treasure of the Empire’ from Emperor Jahangir. Upon arrival check in to 
the hotel. Lunch in Pinch of Spice Restaurant on Fatehabad Road. </p>

<p>In the afternoon sightseeing of Agra Fort. Emperor Akbar moved his 
capital to Agra from Delhi in 1558 but the construction of the Agra Fort
 started in 1565. It was built on the ruins of an earlier fort named 
Badalgarh. The first Mughal Emperor Babur had occupied this fort after 
his victory in the battle of Panipat in 1526 CE. His son, second Mughal 
Emperor Humayun was crowned in the old fort of Badalgarh in 1530. With 
about 4000 laborers and craftsmen toiling for 8 years the fort's 
construction was completed in 1573. The entire fort was built with 
narrow flat brick masonry work and laminated with red sandstone from the
 stone quarry at Sikri village west of Agra. According the Emperor 
Akbar's official biography written by his trusted friend, Abul Fazl, 
there were about 5000 buildings in the fort. Some of these buildings 
were demolished to make way for white marble palaces of Emperor 
Shahjahan, facing the Yamuna River, on the eastern side of the fort. 
Most of the buildings in western side were converted in to soldier’s 
barracks by the British East India Company. The western part of the fort
 is still occupied by Indian military. Emperor Akbar's style was greatly
 influenced by the architecture of the states of Gujarat and Bengal. It 
is also very unique because it reflects Emperor Akbar's tolerant 
religious philosophy. The best of example of his architecture is visible
 in the palace popularly called Jahangiri Mahal. In 1666 the great 
Maratha warrior, Shivaji met with Emperor Aurangzeb but the Mughal 
Emperor broke his promise and arrested him. He managed to escape in a 
spectacular manner by hiding in fruit baskets for distribution to poor. 
The Jat and Maratha ruler occupied Agra Fort in later years. Finally in 
1803 the British East India Company captured it and demolished most of 
its monuments, only about 30 monuments have survived in the 
south-eastern side of the fort. In 1983 the Agra Fort was declared a 
UNESCO World Heritage Monument. </p>
<p>On the way to hotel wonder at the largest collection of Zerdozi 
Embroidery Art in India. This embossed embroidery art is attributed to 
the Mughal Empress Nurjahan. It uses silver, gold and colored silk 
thread embroidery on silk and velvet background and is one of the unique
 arts originating in Mughal period. Overnight stay in hotel in Agra. </p>

<p>Wonder at the world famous Taj Mahal in the glow of morning sunlight.</p>
<p>Ample time in the vast complex for photographing and viewing the 
intricate Pietra Dure (inlay of semi-precious stones in marble art work,
 used in the exterior and interior of the monument. </p>
<p>Prince Khurram (later Emperor Shahjahan) and his father Prince Salim 
met their favorite future queens in a mock market called Meena Bazaar to
 celebrate the Persian new year festival of Nowroz in Agra Fort. Prince 
Salim wanted to marry Mehr un Nissa Begum, the daughter of Mirza Ghiaz 
Beg but Emperor Akbar did not want Shiya influence in the royal family 
so he asked Mirza Ghiaz Beg to marry his daughter to an Afghan commander
 and had him posted in Bihar. Prince Khurram was third eldest and not 
initially in direct line of succession. He was betrothed to Arjumand 
Bano Begum on April 5, 1607 but Prince Salim delayed his marriage. After
 death of Emperor Akbar, Prince Salim ascended the throne with the title
 of Emperor Jahangir and it was only in May 1610 that Mehr un Nissa, the
 widow of the Afghan commander finally agreed to marry him. He honored 
her with the title of Nurjahan (light of the world) after his marriage. 
One year later on May 10, 1612, Prince Khurram was finally allowed to 
marry his beloved Arjumand Bano Begum, who was the niece of Mehr un 
Nissa (her brother’s daughter and granddaughter of Mirza Ghiaz Beg). She
 received the title of Begum Mumtaj Mahal after her marriage with the 
Mughal prince. Begum Mumtaj Mahal was 19 years when they married. She 
was his constant companion and most trusted advisor. During their 19 
years of marriage she gave birth to 14 children of which only 3 
daughters and 4 sons survived. The youngest son, Aurangzeb fought a war 
of succession against his elder brothers. One after the other he won 
against all of them, had all the brothers killed and then put his 
father, Emperor Shahjahan, under arrest in his own palaces in Agra Fort.
 Queen Mumtaj Mahal died on June 17, 1631 while delivering her 14th 
child, a daughter, Gauhar Ara Begum, who survived and lived in 
Shahjahanabad to a ripe age of 75 years. </p>
<p>The site of the Taj Mahal mausoleum was a palace of the Maharaja of 
Amber, Mirza Raja Jai Singh. The Emperor asked him to give the palace 
back to him and gave him other properties in lieu. The queen was 
temporarily buried in Burhanpur where she died in an army encampment. 
The body was transferred to Agra and again temporarily buried in the 
northwest section of the garden of Taj Mahal where a red sandstone 
enclosure still marks the site of her temporary burial. The Taj Mahal 
mausoleum was completed in 1648 according to an inscription on its main 
gate. </p>
<p>The tomb was built exclusively for Queen Mumtaj Mahal, so her grave 
stone is in the center of the grave chamber. Emperor Shahjahan died on 
January 16, 1666 in Mussamam Burj Palace in Agra Fort. He was buried by 
the queen’s side and his grave stone is the only architectural feature 
in this mausoleum that is not symmetrical. Taj Mahal, is a UNESCO World 
Heritage Site. </p>
<p>After breakfast enjoy a demonstration of the art of Pietra Dure 
(inlay of semi-precious stones on marble surface) at Agra's oldest 
emporium where the not for sale section has some artifacts with inlay 
work much finer than the most intricate art work in the Taj Mahal itself
 and perhaps the world's best. </p>
<p>Subsequently visit Sikandara, the tomb of Emperor Akbar. Emperor 
Akbar started the construction of his mausoleum in his own lifetime in 
1604. The emperor's friend, Abul Fazl, describes it in Akbarnama, the 
official and historical chronicle of Emperor Akbar's rule variously as 
Behistan and Behistabad or the abode in paradise. The construction 
continued for a very long time even after Emperor Akbar's demise. 
Emperor Jahangir was displeased with the slow construction and 
personally intervened to expedite it. Between 1612 and 1614, with the 
addition of its main gate that is more impressive than the simple 
mausoleum, the construction finally completed. The motifs and decoration
 on the main gate suggest a Persian influence and Empress Nur Jahan may 
have had a hand in its architecture. </p>
<p>After lunch at Pinch of Spice Restaurant in Sanjay Market in north 
Agra, drive to the Dayalbagh Temple which is actually a memorial of the 
first Guru (Teacher) of the Dayalbagh religious organization. Sir Shiv 
Dayal Sahab established this group in 1861. Its basic tenets are unity 
of God and its philosophy blends elements of Hinduism, Buddhism, 
Jainism, Sikhism and Islam. The construction of Dayalbagh Temple started
 in 1905 and was finally completed in 2018. It is now open to public. It
 has some of the finest sculptural elements in white and colored marble 
as well as very special Pietra Dure art work. After sightseeing return 
to hotel. Rest of afternoon is free to relax.  Overnight stay in hotel 
in Agra. </p>

<h3 class="headingtxt">Day 5 // AGRA - JAIPUR (232 Kilometers or 144 miles in 5 hours): </h3>

<p>After breakfast drive one hour to Fatehpur Sikri for sightseeing of 
Mughal Emperor Akbar’s deserted capital and the tomb of Sufi saint 
Sheikh Salim Chistie in the courtyard of the grand mosque.</p>

<p>Emperor Akbar did not have a male heir to his throne for a long time.
 He came to the Sikri village to seek the blessings of the Sufi saint, 
Sheikh Salim Chistie, who prophesied that Emperor Akbar would have three
 sons. The emperor moved with his Hindu queen, Jodha Bai, to Sikri 
village to live with the saint and started building an alternative 
capital at the site which was earlier a query for red sandstone. The 
entire capital was built with red sandstone from the ridge on which it 
is located. The first born son was named Salim after the Sufi saint. The
 second was named Murad or the longed one. The third son was named 
Daniel, probably influenced by the Jesuit priests from Goa who were 
invited by the Emperor to teach him about Christianity. Emperor Akbar 
developed the philosophy of “Sulah Qul” – living in harmony with all 
religions. Later he developed his own religion, Din-i-Ilahi or faith of 
God. His dear friend and official biographer, Abul Fazl, was among the 
first to convert to the new religion which he described in “Akbar Nama”.
 </p>
<p>Visit the grand Friday “Jama Masjid” and the mausoleum of Sheikh 
Salim Chistie, which was renovated using the white marble by later 
Mughal Emperors. After Emperor Akbar moved away from this capital, 
living there only 14 years, the capital was deserted for more than 400 
years until Lord Curzon, British Viceroy of India ordered the 
Archaeological Survey of India to restore this fascinating capital and 
this renovation work is still going on. The palaces were all covered 
with wild forest and wild animals lived in the palaces. The “Dargah” or 
mausoleum of the saint was never deserted and people from Agra and 
nearby villages have been coming there to seek the saint’s blessings for
 centuries. </p>
