<h3 class="headingtxt">3: Friday, October 24, 2025, DELHI :</h3>

<p>After breakfast sightseeing of Qutub Minar: its construction was 
initiated by Qutubudin-Aibak in 1198 CE upon becoming the first
Sultan of Delhi. Qutubudin-Aibak was born in Turkestan of ethnic Mamluk 
descent. This was a region where youth went out to
neighboring countries and joined their armies as mercenaries. They were 
enslaved when the army they were fighting with lost.
Qutbuddin was sold to the Qazi (Islamic judge) of Nishapur in Persia. 
There he became favorite of his master because of his skills
of horse-riding and archery among other warrior abilities. Qazi’s sons 
were jealous and they sold him after the Qazi’s death. He
ended up as slave of Sultan Muhammad of Ghur province of Afghanistan. He
 led Sultan of Ghur’s army in the 1st and 2nd battle of
Tarain and was appointed Governor of Lalkot, the capital of the last 
Hindu Chauhan dynasty kingdom. When Muhammad of Ghur
was assassinated, Qutubudin-Aibak declared himself sovereign monarch and
 started the construction of Qutub Jami Mosque
(a.k.a. Quwwat ul Islam Mosque) and Qutub Minar. The construction of 
minaret did not complete in his lifetime and many later
Islamic rulers of various successive dynasties left their mark on this 
monument, which is now 5 stories high and 73 meters or 240
feet tall. The mosque was constructed using architectural elements of 27
 Hindu and Jain temples that were demolished to build it.
Much of the decorative pillars and facades of walls in the mosque were 
used without alteration in the new mosque, only the Arabic
verses from the Quran were added new, sculpted by Hindu artisans who did
 not know the Arabic language and curved the endings
of letters as they did with Sanskrit language carvings. Qutub Minar is a
 UNESCO World Heritage Site.
</p>

<p>Later sightseeing of the Second Mughal Emperor Humayun's Tomb - its architecture may have influenced the construction of the
Taj Mahal in Agra. Emperor Humayun died just six months after winning the throne of Delhi in 1556 CE. His widow, Hamida Bano
Begum (a.k.a. Haji Begum) supervised its construction under Mughal Emperor Akbar’s rule. Having recently returned from Persia
and its architect, Mirak Mirza Ghiyath, being a Persian, the monument has elements of Persian and Hindu architecture blended in
it. Many later Mughal rulers are also buried in this mausoleum. Humayun’s Tomb is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. </p>

<p>
Proceed further for sightseeing of India Gate (the war memorial), 
Parliament House and Presidents House (from outside) and for

lunch at Gulati’s Restaurant in Khan Market nearby. The British decided 
in 1911 to move their capital from Calcutta (now Kolkata)
to Delhi. Edwin Landseer Lutyens and his friend Herbert Baker were 
chosen for designing various buildings in the new capital. In
1914 the First World War started and continued until 1918. During this 
period the new capital’s construction was halted. After its
construction completed, the British capital was moved to New Delhi in 
1931. India Gate was originally a monument to honor the
fallen Indian soldiers in World War I, but now honors Indian soldiers 
all subsequent wars. <br><br>
In the afternoon stop by the Red Fort for photography from outside - the
 massive sandstone fort built by Shah Jahan on the banks
of river Yamuna. The fifth Mughal Emperor Shahjahan moved his capital 
from Agra to Delhi in 1636 and started the construction of
the walled “Shahjahanabad” city with 14 gates. The most important gates,
 Mori, Lahori, Ajmeri, Turkman, Kashmiri and Delhi Gates
still exist along with remnants of the wall. Within the city there were 
many monuments constructed but the most ambitious project
was the Red Fort – according to a horoscope done to determine the 
auspicious time for starting its construction, the work on
building the Red Fort started on May 12, 1639. In the Emperor’s Balcony 
in Diwan-i-Am or the Hall of Public Audience, there are a
set of marble panels that were made in Pietra Dure art by the Florentine
 jeweler, Austin de Bordeaux. The most famous of these is
the one depicting Orpheus playing the flute. There are many other 
palaces in the fort that were decorated with inlay of semi-
precious stones in marble. Red Fort is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

<p>
Jama Masjid - is the largest mosque in India and stands across the road from the Red Fort, built by Mughal Emperor Shahjahan
1650-56 CE. It was originally called "Masjid-i-Jahannuma" or world reflecting mosque. Its construction was supervised by Vazir
Saadula Khan and its chief architect was Ustad Khalil. About 25,000 people can pray here at a time.  Overnight in Best Western
Maharani Bagh Hotel in south Delhi.

<h3 class="headingtxt">4: Saturday, October 25, 2025, NEW DELHI – VARANASI :</h3>
<p>Early morning at 5.30 am transfer to airport to board indigo flight 
departing at 8 am and arrive in Varanasi at 10 am. Drive about 26
kilometers in 35 minutes to Sarnath Buddhist archaeological site. one of
 India’s most important archaeological and religious
pilgrimage sites. Buddha preached his first sermon to his initial five 
disciples at Sarnath. 
</p>
<img src="Jewels%20of%20Northern%20India%20Tour%20-%20India%20Traveller_files/Dhamek-Stupa-Sarnath-Varanasi.jpg" alt="" class="lazy"> <br><br>
<p>
After leaving worldly and princely life behind, the youth, Siddharth 
Gautam Shakya had traveled to Varanasi for learning Sanskrit
and ancient scriptures. He had undergone extreme penances at Sarnath, 
before moving to what is today known as Bodhgaya. It
was here he found the path of moderation and enlightening. He returned 
to Sarnath to preach his first sermon to his initial five
disciples. 
</p>
<p>
It is accepted in all chronologies that Lord Buddha lived for 80 years and he passed away (Mahaparinirwana) at Kushalnagara
(present day border of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh) in the Malla Republic. The dates of the Buddha have been derived from various
chronologies which all recognize that Siddhartha Gautama lived for 80 years but disagree on the dates those 80 years encompass.
The chronologies are: (1) Sri Lankan Long Chronology: birth circa 624 and death circa 544 BCE; (2) Corrected Long Chronology:
birth circa 567 and death 487 BCE; Indian Short Chronology: circa 448 and death 368 BCE; Modern Chronology birth circa 563
and death circa 483 BCE.
</p>
<p>
The larger Dhamek Stupa at Sarnath was originally built by Mauryan 
Emperor Ashoka in 249 BCE but the present structure was
renovated in circa 500 CE during the Gupta Period. The Mulgandhi Kuti 
Vihar (Sri Lankan Buddhist Temple) was built at the site
where Buddha preached his first sermon. The archaeological museum in 
Sarnath has some of the most precious and well-
preserved sculptures from this area. India’s national emblem was derived
 the 4-headed Lion capital, this original sculpture is on
permanent exhibition in this museum. After sightseeing of Sarnath drive 
to the hotel for check-in. In the afternoon visit Varanasi’s

Prince Khurram (later Emperor Shahjahan) and his father Prince Salim met
 their favorite future queens in a mock market called
Meena Bazaar to celebrate the Persian new year festival of Nowruz in 
Agra Fort. Prince Salim wanted to marry Mehr un Nissa
Begum, the daughter of Mirza Ghiaz Beg but Emperor Akbar did not want 
Shi’a influence in the royal family so he asked Mirza
Ghiaz Beg to marry his daughter to an Afghan commander and had him 
posted in Bihar. Prince Khurram was third eldest and not
initially in direct line of succession. He was betrothed to Arjumand 
Bano Begum on April 5, 1607 but Prince Salim delayed his
marriage. After death of Emperor Akbar, Prince Salim ascended the throne
 with the title of Emperor Jahangir and it was only in May
1610 that Mehr un Nissa, the widow of the Afghan commander finally 
agreed to marry him. He honored her with the title of Nur
Jahan (light of the world) after his marriage. One year later on May 10,
 1612, Prince Khurram was finally allowed to marry his
beloved Arjumand Bano Begum, who was the niece of Mehr un Nissa (her 
brother’s daughter and granddaughter of Mirza Ghiaz
Beg). She received the title of Begum Mumtaj Mahal after her marriage 
with the Mughal prince. Begum Mumtaj Mahal was 19
years when they married. She was his constant companion and most trusted
 advisor. During their 19 years of marriage, she gave
birth to 14 children of which only 3 daughters and 4 sons survived. The 
youngest son, Aurangzeb fought a war of succession
against his elder brothers. One after the other he won against all of 
them, had all the brothers killed and then put his father,
Emperor Shahjahan, under arrest in his own palaces in Agra Fort. Queen 
Mumtaj Mahal died on June 17, 1631 while delivering her
14th child, a daughter, Gauhar Ara Begum, who survived and lived in 
Shahjahanabad to a ripe age of 75 years.
</p>
<p>
The site of the Taj Mahal mausoleum was a palace of the Maharaja of 
Amber, Mirza Raja Jai Singh. The emperor asked him to give
the palace back to him and gave him other properties in lieu. The queen 
was temporarily buried in Burhanpur where she died in an
army encampment. The body was transferred to Agra and again temporarily 
buried in the northwest section of the garden of Taj
Mahal where a red sandstone enclosure still marks the site of her 
temporary burial. The Taj Mahal mausoleum was completed in
1648 according to an inscription on its main gate. The tomb was built 
exclusively for Queen Mumtaj Mahal, so her grave stone is in
the center of the grave chamber. Emperor Shahjahan died on January 16, 
1666 in Mussamam Burj Palace in Agra Fort. He was
buried by the queen’s side and his grave stone is the only architectural
 feature in this mausoleum that is not symmetrical. Taj
Mahal, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 
</p>
<p>
After breakfast enjoy a demonstration of the art of Pietra Dure (inlay 
of semi-precious stones on marble surface) at Agra's oldest
emporium where the not for sale section has some artifacts with inlay 
work much finer than the most intricate art work in the Taj
Mahal itself and perhaps the world's best.
</p>
<p>
In the afternoon sightseeing of Agra Fort. Emperor Akbar moved his 
capital to Agra from Delhi in 1558 but the construction of the
Agra Fort started in 1565. It was built on the ruins of an earlier fort 
named Badalgarh. The first Mughal Emperor Babur had
occupied this fort after his victory in the battle of Panipat in 1526 
CE. His son, second Mughal Emperor Humayun was crowned in
the old fort of Badalgarh in 1530. With about 4000 laborers and 
craftsmen toiling for 8 years the fort's construction was completed
in 1573. The entire fort was built with narrow flat brick masonry work 
and laminated with red sandstone from the stone quarry at
Sikri village west of Agra. According the Emperor Akbar's official 
biography written by his trusted friend, Abul Fazl, there were
about 5000 buildings in the fort. Some of these buildings were 
demolished to make way for white marble palaces of Emperor
Shahjahan, facing the Yamuna River, on the eastern side of the fort. 
Most of the buildings in western side were converted in to
soldier’s barracks by the British East India Company. The western part 
of the fort is still occupied by Indian military. Emperor
Akbar's style was greatly influenced by the architecture of the states 
of Gujarat and Bengal. It is also very unique because it
reflects Emperor Akbar's tolerant religious philosophy. The best of 
example of his architecture is visible in the palace popularly
called Jahangiri Mahal. In 1666 the great Maratha warrior, Shivaji met 
with Emperor Aurangzeb but the Mughal Emperor broke his
promise and arrested him. He managed to escape in a spectacular manner 
by hiding in fruit baskets for distribution to poor. The Jat
and Maratha rulers occupied Agra Fort in later years. Finally in 1803 
the British East India Company captured it and demolished
most of its monuments, only about 30 monuments have survived in the 
south-eastern side of the fort. In 1983 the Agra Fort was
declared a UNESCO World Heritage Monument.

Later sightseeing of the Tomb of Itmad-ud-Daulah. This is the mausoleum 
built under supervision of Empress Nur Jahan for her

<h3 class="headingtxt">7: Tuesday, October 28, 2025, AGRA – FATEHPUR SIKRI – JAIPUR (206 kilometers, 3.5 hour’s drive) :</h3>
<p>
After breakfast drive one hour to Fatehpur Sikri for sightseeing of 
Mughal Emperor Akbar’s deserted capital and the tomb of Sufi
saint Sheikh Salim Chishti in the courtyard of the grand mosque. Emperor
 Akbar did not have a male heir to his throne for a long
time. He came to the Sikri village to seek the blessings of the Sufi 
saint, Sheikh Salim Chishti, who correctly prophesied that
Emperor Akbar would have three sons. The emperor moved with his Hindu 
queen, Jodha Bai, to Sikri village to live with the saint
and started building an alternative capital at the site which was 
earlier a query for red sandstone. The entire capital was built with
red sandstone from the ridge on which it is located. The first-born son 
was named Salim after the Sufi saint. The second was
named Murad or the longed one. The third son was named Daniel, probably 
influenced by the Jesuit priests from Goa who were
invited by the emperor to teach him about Christianity. Emperor Akbar 
developed the philosophy of “Sulah Qul” – living in harmony
with all religions. Later he developed his own religion, Din-i-Ilahi or 
faith of God. His dear friend and official biographer, Abul Fazl,
was among the first to convert to the new religion which he described in
 “Akbar Nama”.

<p>
Visit the grand Friday “Jama Masjid” and the mausoleum of Sheikh Salim 
Chishti, which was renovated using the white marble by
later Mughal Emperors. After Emperor Akbar moved away from this capital,
 living there only 14 years, the capital was deserted for
more than 400 years until Lord Curzon, British Viceroy of India ordered 
the Archaeological Survey of India to restore this
fascinating capital and this renovation work is still going on. The 
palaces were all covered with wild forest and wild animals lived in
the palaces. The “Dargah” or mausoleum of the saint was never deserted 
and people from Agra and nearby villages have been
coming there to seek the saint’s blessings for centuries.
