<h4>ITINERARY :</h4>
<h3 class="headingtxt">Day 1: Delhi :</h3>
<p>Arrive in Indira Gandhi International Airport, New Delhi. Traditional
 welcome with fresh flower garland and transfer to hotel for
overnight.</p>
<h3 class="headingtxt">Day 2: Delhi :</h3>
<p>After breakfast sightseeing of Qutub Minar: its construction was 
initiated by Qutubudin-Aibak in 1198 CE upon becoming the
first Sultan of Delhi. Qubub Uddin Aibak was born in Turkestan of ethnic
 Mamluk descent. This was a region where youth went
out to neighboring countries and joined their armies as mercenaries. 
Often they were enslaved when the army they were fighting
with lost. Qutubuddin was sold to the Qazi (Islamic judge) of Nishapur 
in Persia. There he became favorite of his master
because of his skills of horse-riding and archery among other warrior 
abilities. Qazi’s sons were jealous and they sold him after
the Qazi’s death. Finally he ended up as slave of Sultan Muhammad of 
Ghur province of Afghanistan. He led Sultan of Ghur’s
army in the 1st and 2nd battles of Tarain and was appointed Governor of 
Lalkot, the capital of the last Hindu Chauhan dynasty
kingdom. When Muhammad of Ghur was assassinated, Qutubuddin bin Aibak 
declared himself sovereign monarch and started
the construction of Qutub Jami Mosque (a.k.a. Quwwat ul Islam Mosque) 
and Qutub Minar. The construction of minaret did not
complete in his lifetime and many later Islamic rulers of various 
successive dynasties left their mark on this monument, which is
now 5 stories high and 73 meters or 240 feet tall. The mosque was 
constructed using architectural elements of 27 Hindu and
Jain temples that were demolished to build it. Much of the decorative 
pillars and facades of walls in the mosque were used
without alteration in the new mosque, only the Arabic verses from the 
Quran were added new, sculpted by Hindu artisans who
did not know the Arabic language. They curved the endings of letters as 
they did with Sanskrit language carvings. Qutub Minar
is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Later sightseeing of the Second Mughal 
Emperor Humayun's Tomb - its architecture
may have influenced the construction of the Taj Mahal in Agra. Emperor 
Humayun died just six months after winning the throne
of Delhi in 1556 CE. His widow, Hamida Bano Begum (a.k.a. Haji Begum) 
supervised its construction under Mughal Emperor
Akbar’s rule. Having recently returned from Persia and its architect, 
Mirak Mirza Ghiyath, being a Persian, the monuments has
elements of Persian and Hindu architecture blended in it. Many later 
Mughal rulers are also buried in this mausoleum.
Humayun’s Tomb is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>

<p>Proceed further for sightseeing of India Gate (the war memorial), 
Parliament House and Presidents House (from outside) and
for lunch at Gulati’s Restaurant in Khan Market nearby. The British 
decided in 1911 to move their capital from Calcutta (now
Kolkata) to Delhi. Edwin Landseer Lutyens and his friend Herbert Baker 
were chosen for designing various buildings in the new
capital. In 1914 the First World War started and continued until 1918. 
During this period the new capital’s construction was
halted. Finally after its construction completed, the British capital 
was moved to New Delhi in 1931. India Gate was originally a
monument to honor the fallen Indian soldiers in World War I, but now 
honors Indian soldiers all subsequent wars. Drive past
Parliament Street where the architecture of some of the modern buildings
 in early 20 th century CE was influenced by the Jantar
Mantar astronomical observatory that Sawai Jai Singh II built here.</p>
<p>In the afternoon stop by the Red Fort for photography from outside - the massive sandstone fort built by Shah Jahan on the
banks of river Yamuna. The fifth Mughal Emperor Shahjahan moved his capital from Agra to Delhi in 1636 and started the
construction of the walled “Shahjahanabad” city with 14 gates. The most important gates, Mori, Lahori, Ajmeri, Turkman,
Kashmiri and Delhi Gates still exist along with some remnants of the wall. Within the city there were many monuments
constructed but the most ambitious project was the Red Fort – according to a horoscope done to determine the auspicious time
for starting its construction, the work on building the Red Fort started on May 12, 1639. In the Emperor’s Balcony in Diwan-i-Am
or the Hall of Public Audience, there are a set of marble panels that were made in Pietra Dure art by the Florentine jeweler,
Austin de Bordeaux. The most famous of these is the one depicting Orpheus playing the flute. There are many other palaces in
the fort that were decorated with inlay of semi-precious stones in marble. Red Fort is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>

<p>
Jama Masjid - is the largest mosque in India and stands across the road from the Red Fort, built by Mughal Emperor Shahjahan
1650-56 CE. It was originally called "Masjid-i-Jahannuma" or world reflecting mosque. Its construction was supervised by Vazir
Saadula Khan and its chief architect was Ustad Khalil. About 25,000 people can pray here at a time. End the day with thrilling
Rickshaw Ride in narrow lanes between Jama Masjid and Chandni Chowk Bazaar. Transfer to domestic airport to board

<h3 class="headingtxt">Day 3: Jaipur :</h3>

<p>After breakfast drive through the walled pink city to Hawa Mahal, which is mere facade with about 3 feet deep balconies behind
stone carved, latticed screens where royal family women used to sit to watch the royal processions on the street in front.
After photographing drive further through the pink city to Amber Fort, the ancient capital of Kachwaha Maharajas before
Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh designed India’s first planned city in ca. 1727 CE.</p>
<p>
Enjoy a royal ride on decorated Elephants to the hilltop palaces of 
Amber Fort. The two main palace complexes in the fort
belong to the reigns of Mirza Raja Jai Singh (1621 – 1667 CE) and 
Maharaja Man Singh (1589 – 1614 CE). Maharaja Man
Singh already as a prince was in the service of Mughal Emperors. He 
established a life-long friendship with Emperor Akbar
already in his younger years and was honored as one of the nine 
“Navratnas” (the 9 Jewels of Emperor’s court). He was
governor of Bengal under Emperor Akbar and brought back the idol of 
Shila Devi that is now in the Kali Temple in Amber Fort.
The descendants of the priests who accompanied the idol to Amber still 
serve in this temple. Mirza Raja Jai Singh served as a
courtier and commander under Mughal Emperors Akbar, Jahangir and 
Shahjahan. The first palace entering from the Ganesh Pol
gate was constructed during his reign and has influence of Mughal 
architectural style. It is most famous for the flat and convex
mirror decorations on its walls and ceilings. After sightseeing descend 
by Jeeps and return to Jaipur city with stop on the way at
Jal Mahal Island Palace for photographing.

<p>In the afternoon visit the City Palace of Jaipur. Sightseeing 
includes the Royal portraits gallery in the Diwan-i-Am (Hall of Public
Audience), the Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audience) where the famous 
“Gangajalis” – the silver urns are on display; these
urns were used to carry Ganga river water to London when Maharaja Madho 
Singh II went there for celebrations of the
coronation of King Edward VII in 1901; the Mor Chowk (peacock) courtyard
 of Chandra Mahal, the palace where the present
head of the Jaipur royal still resides. One of the gates leading into 
the courtyard has beautiful sculptures of Peacocks giving it
the name of Mayur (Peacock) Chowk. Stepping out the City Palace through 
its southern courtyard visit the world famous
“Yantra Shala” astronomical observatory popularly called Jantar Mantar 
constructed by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II. It is the
largest of the five astronomical observatories built by the Maharaja. 
All but one of its 17 instruments are still functional. It is now
a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The “Brihad Samrat Yantra” or the large 
sundial here is largest in the world and has an
accuracy of 2 seconds. Overnight in Jaipur hotel.</p>

<h3 class="headingtxt">Day 4: Jaipur – Abhineri - Fatehpur Sikri – Agra  :</h3>
<p>After breakfast drive to Dausa town near Abhineri Village to view the Chand Baori, the world's deepest step-well and the nearby
Harshad Mata Godess Temple. Drive further to Fatehpur Sikri for sightseeing of Mughal Emperor Akbar’s deserted capital and
the tomb of Sufi saint Sheikh Salim Chistie in the courtyard of the grand mosque.</p>
<p>
Emperor Akbar did not have a male heir to his throne for a long time. He
 came to the Sikri village to seek the blessings of the
Sufi saint, Sheikh Salim Chistie, who prophesied that Emperor Akbar 
would have three sons. The emperor moved with his Hindu
queen, Jodha Bai, to Sikri village to live with the saint and started 
building an alternative capital at the site which was earlier a
query for red sandstone. The entire capital was built with red sandstone
 from the ridge on which it is located. The first born son
was named Salim after the Sufi saint. The second was named Murad or the 
longed one. The third son was named Daniel,
probably influenced by the Jesuit priests from Goa who were invited by 
the Emperor to teach him about Christianity. Emperor
Akbar developed the philosophy of “Sulah Qul” – living in harmony with 
all religions. Later he developed his own religion, Din-i-

Ilahi or faith of God. His dear friend and official biographer, Abul 
Fazl, was among the first to convert to the new religion which he
described in “Akbar Nama”.
</p>
<p>
Visit the grand Friday “Jama Masjid” and the mausoleum of Sheikh Salim 
Chistie, which was renovated using the white marble
by later Mughal Emperors. After Emperor Akbar moved away from this 
capital, living there only 14 years, the capital was
deserted for more than 400 years until Lord Curzon, British Viceroy of 
India ordered the Archaeological Survey of India to restore
this fascinating capital and this renovation work is still going on. The
 palaces were all covered with wild forest and wild animals
lived in the palaces. The “Dargah” or mausoleum of the saint was never 
deserted and people from Agra and nearby villages
have been coming there to seek the saint’s blessings for centuries. 
Fatehpur Sikri is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
</p>
<p>
On arrival in Agra check-in to hotel and sightseeing of 
Itmad-ud-Daulah’s mausoleum. This mausoleum was built under
supervision of Empress Nur Jahan for her parents, Mirza Ghiaz Beg 
(honored by Emperor Jahangir with title of Itmad-ud-
Daulah) and Begum Asmat in 1628 almost 7 years after her father’s death.
 It was the first Mughal mausoleum built using white
marble and with inlay art. It has some very feminine decorations like 
the chikan embroidery like carvings in the arches and lots of
Persian motifs signifying the origin of the two persons buried there. 
Later wonder at the largest collection of Zerdozi Embroidery
Art in India. This embossed embroidery art is attributed to the Mughal 
Empress Nurjahan. It uses silver, gold and colored silk
thread embroidery on silk and velvet background and is one of the unique
 arts originating in Mughal period.
</p>

<h3 class="headingtxt">Day 5: Agra :</h3>

<p>
Prince Khurram (later Emperor Shahjahan) and his father Prince Salim met
 their favorite future queens in a mock market called
Meena Bazaar to celebrate the Persian new year festival of Nowroz in 
Agra Fort. Prince Salim wanted to marry Mehr un Nissa
Begum, the daughter of Mirza Ghiaz Beg but Emperor Akbar did not want 
Shiya influence in the royal family so he asked Mirza
Ghiaz Beg to marry his daughter to an Afghan commander and had him 
posted in Bihar. Prince Khurram was third eldest and
not initially in direct line of succession. He was betrothed to Arjumand
 Bano Begum on April 5, 1607 but Prince Salim delayed
his marriage. After death of Emperor Akbar, Prince Salim ascended the 
throne with the title of Emperor Jahangir and it was only
in May 1610 that Mehr un Nissa, the widow of the Afghan commander 
finally agreed to marry him. He honored her with the title
of Nurjahan (light of the world) after his marriage. One year later on 
May 10, 1612, Prince Khurram was finally allowed to marry
his beloved Arjumand Bano Begum, who was the niece of Mehr un Nissa (her
 brother’s daughter and granddaughter of Mirza
Ghiaz Beg). She received the title of Begum Mumtaj Mahal after her 
marriage with the Mughal prince. Begum Mumtaj Mahal was
19 years when they married. She was his constant companion and most 
trusted advisor. During their 19 years of marriage she
gave birth to 14 children of which only 3 daughters and 4 sons survived.
 The youngest son, Aurangzeb fought a war of
succession against his elder brothers. One after the other he won 
against all of them, had all the brothers killed and then put his
father, Emperor Shahjahan, under arrest in his own palaces in Agra Fort.
 Queen Mumtaj Mahal died on June 17, 1631 while
delivering her 14th child, a daughter, Gauhar Ara Begum, who survived 
and lived in Shahjahanabad to a ripe age of 75 years.
</p>
<p>
The site of the Taj Mahal mausoleum was a palace of the Maharaja of Amber, Mirza Raja Jai Singh. The Emperor asked him to
give the palace back to him and gave him other properties in lieu. The queen was temporarily buried in Burhanpur where she
died in an army encampment. The body was transferred to Agra and again temporarily buried in the northwest section of the

garden of Taj Mahal where a red sandstone enclosure still marks the site of her temporary burial. The Taj Mahal mausoleum was
completed in 1648 according to an inscription on its main gate. The tomb was built exclusively for Queen Mumtaj Mahal, so her
grave stone is in the center of the grave chamber. Emperor Shahjahan died on January 16, 1666 in Mussamam Burj Palace in
Agra Fort. He was buried by the queen’s side and his grave stone is the only architectural feature in this mausoleum that is not
symmetrical. Taj Mahal, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
</p>
<p>
After breakfast enjoy a demonstration of the art of Pietra Dure (inlay 
of semi-precious stones on marble surface) at Agra's oldest
emporium where the not for sale section has some artifacts with inlay 
work much finer than the most intricate art work in the Taj
Mahal itself and perhaps the world's best.

In the afternoon sightseeing of Agra Fort. Emperor Akbar moved his 
capital to Agra from Delhi in 1558 but the construction of
the Agra Fort started in 1565. It was built on the ruins of an earlier 
fort named Badalgarh. The first Mughal Emperor Babur had
occupied this fort after his victory in the battle of Panipat in 1526 
CE. His son, second Mughal Emperor Humayun was crowned
in the old fort of Badalgarh in 1530. With about 4000 laborers and 
craftsmen toiling for 8 years the fort's construction was
completed in 1573. The entire fort was built with narrow flat brick 
masonry work and laminated with red sandstone from the
stone quarry at Sikri village west of Agra. According the Emperor 
Akbar's official biography written by his trusted friend, Abul
Fazl, there were about 5000 buildings in the fort. Some of these 
buildings were demolished to make way for white marble
palaces of Emperor Shahjahan, facing the Yamuna River, on the eastern 
side of the fort. Most of the buildings in western side
were converted in to soldier’s barracks by the British East India 
Company. The western part of the fort is still occupied by Indian
military. Emperor Akbar's style was greatly influenced by the 
architecture of the states of Gujarat and Bengal. It is also very
unique because it reflects Emperor Akbar's tolerant religious 
philosophy. The best of example of his architecture is visible in the
palace popularly called Jahangiri Mahal. In 1666 the great Maratha 
warrior, Shivaji met with Emperor Aurangzeb but the Mughal
Emperor broke his promise and arrested him. He managed to escape in a 
spectacular manner by hiding in fruit baskets for
distribution to poor. The Jat and Maratha ruler occupied Agra Fort in 
later years. Finally in 1803 the British East India Company
captured it and demolished most of its monuments, only about 30 
monuments have survived in the south-eastern side of the fort.
In 1983 the Agra Fort was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Monument.

<h3 class="headingtxt">Day 9: Varanasi – Bhopal :</h3>
<p>
Morning is free to relax in hotel. Later transfer to airport to board 
the Indigo flight 6E 497 to Delhi and connect to 6E 2433 to
arrive at Bhopal at 12.35 pm. On arrival transfer to hotel in Bhopal. 
Bhopal is the capital of Madhya Pradesh, the state with the
largest area in India. The region around this city has been inhabited 
since the late Stone Age. Sardar Dost Muhammad Khan, an
Afghan soldier rose in ranks of Mughal army. Emperor Aurangzeb appointed
 him as Governor of the small territory of Bhairsa. In
1723 he declared himself independent. The rule of so-called Begums of 
Bhopal started in 1819 when the eighteen-year old
Qudsia Begum, who is also known as Gohar Begum, had to take over the 
duties of the monarch of Bhopal after the sudden
assassination of her husband. She was the first female ruler of Bhopal 
and only the second after Razia Sultana (thirteenth
century) in the entire Islamic world. She did not have any formal 
education and was consequently illiterate. In 1844 her daughter,
Nawab Sikander Begum ascended the throne formally. She had been trained 
in the martial arts and the warfare education of the
contemporary period. Sultan Kaikhusrau Jahan Begum, her daughter 
followed her in 1901. She worked for the emancipation of
women that must have been quite radical in her times. She also 
established a modern municipal system. She had her palace,
the Sardar Manzil, constructed. This building now houses the Bhopal 
Municipal Corporation.
</p>
<p>
In 1984 Bhopal drew the attention of the world when the terrible tragedy of cyanide gas leakage from the chemical factory of the
US owned Union Carbide near the railway station, killed hundreds of people. Thousands of others suffered from various ailments
including blindness caused by the poisonous gas.
</p>
<p>
Most of the architectural monuments of Bhopal belong to the reign of 
Begums. In 1837 Kudsia Begum had a beautiful mosque
constructed that has minarets crowned with golden spikes. It served as 
the main Jama Masjid of the city. Sikander Jahan, her
daughter had the Moti Masjid constructed in 1860 that is modeled on Jama
 Masjid of Delhi built by Mughal Emperor Shah
Jahan. Nawab Shah Jahan Begum had Taj-ul-Masajid, one of largest mosques
 in Asia constructed in the last years of nineteenth
century. The Masajid (plural of Masjid) in its name signifies that it 
was the crown of all mosques. It has a very impressive western
wall inside with eleven recessed arches. The pulpit of Imam in the 
mosque is made out of black basalt stone. The minarets of
the mosque are octagonal and eighteen stories high. They are topped with
 onion shaped domes. The main palaces of the
Nawab Era in Bhopal are the Gohar Mahal and Shaukat Mahal. Both are in 
the old part of the city in the Chowk area. Gohar
Mahal on the banks of the upper lake of Bhopal was constructed in a 
blend of Hindu and Mughal architectural styles in 1890
under the patronage of Qudsia Begum. The Shaukat Mahal is right at the 
entrance to the Chowk area, the heart of Bhopal city. It
was designed by a Frenchman in the service of Bhopal Nawabs who was 
believed to be a descendent of Bourbon monarchs of
France. He designed it in a charming fusion of Post-Renaissance and 
Gothic styles. Its architecture makes it a very conspicuous
historical building that is in stark contrast to the predominantly 
Islamic architecture of all other nearby buildings.
</p>
<p>
Bharat Bhawan is the one of the most important national cultural 
institutions in India. The building was designed by the famous
architect, Charles Correa. The center has a museum of arts, an art 
gallery, a workshop of visual fine arts, a theatre for
performing arts with a separate rehearsal room and a library of Indian 
poetry as well as classical and folk music. The center is
open from 2 to 8 PM every day except Mondays. The Indira Gandhi 
Rashtriya Manav Sangrahalaya (National Museum of
Mankind) is a unique museum, spread over 200 acres of undulating land on
 the Shamla Hills on the Upper Lake front. It is
situated on a prehistoric site and may be the only museum in the world 
strewn with numerous prehistoric painted rock shelters. It
is a post colonial museum of communities rather than objects. The museum
 display has been curated directly by the folk and
tribal communities, camping at site, to create a miniature presentation 
of Indian folk lifestyle through display of eco-specific
habitations &amp; subsistence practices in the tribal, coastal, desert, 
and Himalayan habitats. The library, audio-visual archive,
computerized documentation and the collection of ethnographic specimens 
in the museum, though modest in size are among
the best in the world. Government Archaeological Museum has an 
impressive collection of sculptures from various parts of
Madhya Pradesh. Some of the important artifacts in the collection are 
paintings of various schools, copies of paintings from the
Bagh caves near Mandu and the statues of Alakshmi and the Buddha. The 
museum is closed on Mondays. Laxmi Narayan
Temple and Museum is a unique place of Hindu worship that also has a 
museum attached to it. It is located in Arera Hills area
and has a collection of sculptures from Raisen, Sehore, Mandsaur and 
Shahdol districts of Madhya Pradesh. It is open from 9am
to 5pm everyday except Mondays.
</p>
<p>
Another palace of the Nawab era is also a luxury five-star heritage hotel called the Jehan Numa Palace. General Obaidullah
Khan, the second eldest son of Nawab Sultan Jahan, who was the commander-in-chief of the army of the Nawab of Bhopal had
this palace constructed in 1890. Its architecture is a medley of British colonial, Italian renaissance and the Classical Greek
Styles. The sixty-room palace is nestled on the slopes of Shamla Hills surrounded by five acres of lush green grass, exotic and
local trees and plants with conspicuous splashes of colorful bougainvillea.
</p>

<img src="North%20Central%20India%20Journey%20Tour%20-%20India%20Traveller_files/Sanchi-Madhya-Pradesh-Buddhist-Stupa.jpg" alt="" class="lazy"> <br><br>
<h3 class="headingtxt">Day 10: Bhopal – Sanchi :</h3>
<p>
After breakfast drive about 50 kilometers or 31 miles to Sanchi, a small
 town in the Raisen district that is world famous for its
ancient Buddhist archeological site, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 
1989. On a flat topped sandstone hill, rising about 300
feet (90 meters) above surrounding country is the location of Sanchi 
Buddhist Pilgrim center, India's best preserved group of
Buddhist monuments. In the 3rd century BCE, the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka 
spread the Buddhist religion all over the Indian
sub-continent. He had the Ashoka Stambha, a monolithic pillar topped by 
an elaborate capital, constructed at this site giving it an
exalted pilgrimage status. At the same time he had a great brick stupa 
erected here. The monuments at the site were incresed in
size and more intricately sculpted over a long period starting from the 
3rd century BCE to 12th century CE. A gem of Buddhist
art and architecture, the Great Stupa is 120 feet (37 meters) wide and 
54 feet (17 meters) high. The Ashoka Pillar structure is
influenced by the Greco Buddhist style. The pillar is 42 feet tall and 
consisted of a round and slightly tapering monolithic shaft,
with bell-shaped capital surmounted by an abacus and a crowning ornament
 of four regal lions facing in four directions, with their
backs to each other. It has an Ashokan inscription and an inscription in
 the ornamental Sankha Lipi (script) from the Gupta
period. There are other smaller stupas that are also intricately 
sculpted. In the Sunga dynasty period from 184 to 72 BCE the
simple brick stupa was covered with an ashlar stone veneer, and 
augmented with circumambulatory paths and staircases with
ornate balustrades, harmika, yashti, chhatra, and four torana. These 
toranas were ornamented during the Satavahanas dynasty
in the 1st century CE. The last major expansion of the stupa and its 
decoration took place in the Gupta dynasty period in 5th
century CE. Later rulers of various dynasties continued the 
architectural work on this site until the 12th century CE. The site was
a major religious pilrimage site for Buddhsts until 13th century. Even 
now Buddhists from all over the world come to this
pilgrimage site.
</p>
<p>
About 13 kilometers or 8 miles from Sanchi monuments are the Udayagiri 
Caves. Situated about 5 km west of Vidisha and 13
km from Sanchi, these Gupta period caves, are a testament to the skill 
of the artisans carving religious sculptures so intricate
and grand that they still inspire aesthetic awe. There are 20 caves in 
all and one should try to visit as many as possible. The
caves were carved out of sandstone hills in the 4th and 5th centuries. 
Brahmi inscriptions have been found in the caves that
have been influential in ascertaining their timeline. The relief 
sculptures, like the iconographic one of Lord Vishnus varaha or
boar incarnation in Cave 5, has been accepted as one of the most 
accomplished examples of Gupta art. The varaha avatar tells
the story of how Lord Vishnu saved Goddess Earth from demon Hiranyaksha,
 who had abducted and taken her into the deep
ocean. The panel measures an impressive 7x4 sq m. The scene has also 
been hailed as an allegorical statement by the Gupta
kings about their might in protecting their land (earth) from all evils.
 These cave temples have been considered among the best
and the earliest examples of religious architecture in India. The shrine
 holding the shivling is especially interesting as its walls
are decorated with intricate mythological carvings. One cave is related 
to Jainism. After sightseeing of Sanchi and Udayagiri
Caves return to hotel in Bhopal.
</p>
<h3 class="headingtxt">Day 11: Bhopal – Ujjain (191 kilometers or 119 miles in about 4.5 hours) :</h3>
<p>
After breakfast drive from hotel in Bhopal to Ujjain. On arrival 
transfer to Hotel Imperial, 0.5 miles from Sawai Jai Singh II’s
Jantar Mantar astronomical observatory (3-star) or Hotel Abike Elite,

Mahakaleshwar. Overnight in hotel.
</p>
<h3 class="headingtxt">Day 12: Ujjain – Indore (55 kilometers in about 1 hour) :</h3>
<p>
After breakfast drive about an hour to Indore. A trading hub between the
 Deccan and Delhi in the 16th century, the city of Indore
was discovered by Rao Nandlal Chaudhary. But it was developed by the 
Holkar Rani Ahilya Bai. The city of Indore owes much of
its success to the Holkar regime, to be specific, the Queen of Holkar, 
Rani Ahilya Bai. Born in 1725, Ahilya Bai accidentally
walked on to the stage of history. When she was eight, Malhar Rao 
Holkar, army commander to Peshwa Bajirao, spotted her at a

temple service in Chondi. So impressed was he by her character that he 
decided to get his son, Khande Rao, married to her.
Ahilya Bai took control of Malwa after her husband's death in the battle
 of Kumbher in 1754. She excelled at administrative and
military strategies under the guidance of her father-in-law. She then 
laid the foundation of the indomitable Holkar army in 1792
and became one of the most feared archers of her time. The city is 
ranked as "the cleanest city in India" for the sixth consecutive
year and has reserved its place among the first 20 cities to be 
developed as smart cities in India.
</p>
<p>
Sightseeing: The pride of Holkar rulers, the 7-storied Rajwada palace, is located near Khajuri Bazar and holds the position of
one of the most important monuments in Indore. Early in 20th century a local merchant, follower of Jain religion, Seth Hukum
Chand built the beautiful Kanch Mandir, a Jain temple completely with glass and mirrors. Bada Ganpati temple built in 1875 CE
holds an 8-foot tall statue of lord Ganesh. Between 1886 and 1921 CE during the reigns of Tukoji Rao II, Shivaji Rao and Tukoji
Rao III. Overnight in hotel in Indore.
</p>
<h3 class="headingtxt">Day 13: Indore – Mandu – Maheshwar :</h3>
<p>After breakfast in hotel drive about 83 kilometers or 52 miles in about 2 hours to Mandu.</p>
<p>Mandu is the popular name of a former princely state. Its original name is Mandavgad had its origin from a statue that a local
merchant, Chandra Simha, installed in 612 Vikram Samvat Hindu calendar equivilant to 555 CE, in a Jain temple dedicated to
Bhagwan Paraswanath in Mandap Durg (the present name of the town Mandu is a corrupted version of Mandap and Durg in
Hindi language means a fort. Mandu is located at an altitude of 633 meters or 2079 feet above sealevel. It overlooks the plateau
of Malwa to the north and the Narmada river valley to the south.</p>
<p>Mandu came into historical prominence in 10th &amp; 11th centuries under Parmaar rulers. Balban attacked the region as the
commander of Sultan Nasir ud Din Mahmud, the last Shamsi Sultan. In 1305 CE Sultan Allauddin Khalji conquerred Mandu and
established the Khalji dynasty of Malwa (1435 to 1531 CE). It was later conquerred by Sultan Bahadur Shah of Gujarat, who in
turn was defeated by the second Mughal Emperor Nasiruddin Muhammad Humayun. After changing hands between a
succession of rulers finally the 3rd Mughal Emperor Akbar took control of entire Malwa region including Mandu. Its famous
erstwhile ruler Baz Bahadur surrendered to Emperor Akbar and remained in his court. His beloved Rani Rupmati had earlier
committed suicide when she heard that Emperor Akbar's commander Adham Khan had conquerred Mandu. Its past military
glory can be gauged by the nearly 37 kilometers or 23 miles long battlemented wall that has 12 heavily fortified gateways. The
wall encloses a large number of palaces, mosques, Jain temples of 14th century and other buildings. The oldest mosque dates
from 1405; the finest is the Jama Masjid or great mosque, a notable example of Pashtun architecture. The marble-domed tomb
of this ruler is magnificent.</p>
<p>Among the architectural attractions of Mandu, the most prominent is 
the Rani Rupmati's Pavillion. She was the beloved of the
ruler, Baz Bahadur. Even today in the villages of Malwa the balads of 
the love story of the Rani Rupmati and Baz Bahadur is
sung. The Pavillion was originally built as an army post. Later Rani 
Rupmati lived in it and is supposed to have gazed at the Baz
Bahadur's Palace located at a lower level as well as at the plains 
surrounding the Narmada river that the Rani revered.
Built by Baz Bahadur, this 16th-century the Baz Bahadur Palace is famous
 for its grand courtyards surrounded by massive halls
and high terraces.</p>
<p>
Rewa Kund is a reservoir constructed by Baz Bahadur for supplying water to Rani Roopmati's Pavilion. The reservoir is
situated below the pavilion and is considered an architectural marvel.<br><br>
Darya Khan Tomb: In the center of a massive courtyard is the tomb of Darya Khan and one other tomb, a mosque, a pool of
water and an Sarai (Inn), all surrounded by a high wall.
Hathi Paga Mahal (palace) is located to the southeast of Darya Khan Tomb complex and is crowned by a large domb.<br><br>
Shri Mandavagadh Teerth is a Shwetambar Jain (white robe wearing Jain monks) dedicated to Bhagwan Suparshvanath. It is
an older shrine but was extensively renovated in 14th century CE. The 3 feet high idol of the Jain Tirthankar is made of white
stone and iseated in Padmasana (lotus / cross legged posture. In the same complex is another smaller Jain temple dedicated to
Tirthankar Swaminath Bhagwan. According Jain writings there were originally more than 700 temples in this area.<br><br>
Jami Masjid Inspired by the great mosque of Damascus, this enormous structure is striking in both its simplicity and
architectural style-with large courtyards and grand entrances. At the front of Jaami Mosque, there are ruins of Asharfi Palace.
There is a fascinating Ram Temple nearby, which was built by Maharani Sakarwar Bai Pawar in 1769 CE.<br><br>
Hoshang Shah's Tomb India's first marble structure, it is one of the 
most refined examples of Afghan architecture. Its unique
features include the beautifully proportioned dome, intricate marble 
lattice work and porticoed courts and towers. It served as a
template for the construction of Taj Mahal.<br><br>
Jahaz Mahal/Ship Palace Situated between two artificial lakes, this 
two-storied architectural marvel is so named as it appears
as a ship floating in water. Built by Sultan Ghiyas-ud-din-Khalji, it 
served as a harem for the sultan. This is The Water Palace
shown in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1832, from a painting by 
Copley Fielding together with a poetical illustration by
Letitia Elizabeth Landon. Apart from the enthralling architecture, Jahaz
 Mahal is also a significant venue for the vibrant colours of
the Mandu festival. With a series of adventure activities, music shows, 
lights, and balloon festivals that happen every year in the
winter season. Along with a colourful celebration, the sound and light 
show at the Jahaz Mahal is another interesting event that
holds the eyes of every tourist.<br><br>
Hindola Mahal - meaning Swing palace is so named due to its sloping side walls. The Hindola Mahal might have been
constructed during the reign of Hushang Shah about 1425 C.E. but may date to the end of the 15th century during the reign of
Ghiyas al-Din. It is one of a set buildings making up the royal palace complex at Mandu, which consists of the Jahaz Mahal, the
Hindola Mahal, the Taveli Mahal, and the Nahar Jharokha. The Hindola Mahal may have been used as an audience chamber.<br><br>

Songarh/ Sonergarh Fort: The fort was once an impregnable citadel and part of the historic hillfort of Mandu, now in ruins,
which stands in a spectacular, naturally-defended position on a plateau of the Vindhya hills surrounded by a ravine. The citadel
is separated from the main hill by a narrow neck of land.
