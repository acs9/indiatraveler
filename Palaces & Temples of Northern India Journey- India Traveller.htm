enthralling and captivating journey that starts from the 3000 year old capital of modern India. It was the capital
of 8 mighty empires before its present status as the political capital of free India. Lodi dynasty’s second last
Sultan Sikandar Lodi moved his capital to northwest Agra and named it after him as Sikandara in 1506. The
first Mughal Emperor Zahiruddin Muhammad Babur decided to keep Agra as his capital and built garden
palaces on eastern shore of the Agra, one of these still survives and is called Aram Bagh. It was under
Emperor Jalaluddin Muhammad Akbar that not only Agra but India’s fame spread worldwide. Many travelers
and chroniclers came to his court in Agra Fort (1556 – 1605) and Fatehpur Sikri (1571-1585). Fatehpur Sikri
was lived in for a short period and then deserted for almost 400 years until British East India Company Viceroy

Lord George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston, ordered the Archaeological Survey of India
to renovate the erstwhile capital. The fifth Mughal Emperor Shahjahan ruled from Agra Fort where he replaced
many red sandstone buildings with grand white marble palaces decorated with intricate inlaid semi-precious
stones. Emperor Khurram Shahab-ud-din Muhammad Shah Jahan ruled from Agra Fort after he ascended the
Mughal throne in 1628. He built the new walled capital “Shahjahanabad” in 1638. The Kachhwaha rulers of
Amber and later Jaipur were allied with Mughal rulers already from Emperor Babur’s time. Sawai Jai Singh II
moved his capital from Amber to a new, India’s first planned city designed in grid patterned streets and is now
popularly called Jaipur. This journey introduces you to the Hindu Rajput rulers of the erstwhile Rajputana. Each
of the city capitals in this tour is very unique in its style of architecture. This tour can be planned to include the
famous Pushkar Camel Fair (October/November).</p>

<h3 class="headingtxt">Day 1 Delhi :</h3>
<p>Arrive at India Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi. Traditional welcome with fresh marigold flower
garland and transfer to hotel.</p>

<h3 class="headingtxt">Day 2 Delhi :</h3>
<p>After breakfast sightseeing of Qutub Minar: its construction was initiated by Qutubudin-Aibak in 1198 CE upon
becoming the first Sultan of Delhi.</p>
<p>
Qubub Uddin Aibak was born in Turkestan of ethnic Mamluk descent. This was a region where youth went out
to neighboring countries and joined their armies as mercenaries. Often they were enslaved when the army they
were fighting with lost. Qutubuddin was sold to the Qazi (Islamic judge) of Nishapur in Persia. There he
became favorite of his master because of his skills of horseriding and archery among other warrior abilities.
Qazi’s sons were jealous and they sold him after the Qazi’s death. Finally he ended up as slave of Sultan
Muhammad of Ghur province of Afghanistan. He led Sultan of Ghur’s army in the 1st and 2nd battle of Tarain
and was appointed Governor of Lalkot, the capital of the last Hindu Chauhan dynasty kingdom. When
Muhammad of Ghur was assassinated, Qutubuddin bin Aibak declared himself sovereign monarch and started
the construction of Qutub Jami Mosque (a.k.a. Quwwat ul Islam Mosque) and Qutub Minar. The construction of
minaret did not complete in his lifetime and many later Islamic rulers of various successive dynasties left their
mark on this monument, which is now 5 stories high and 73 meters or 240 feet tall. The mosque was
constructed using architectural elements of 27 Hindu and Jain temples that were demolished to build it. Much
of the decorative pillars and facades of walls in the mosque were used without alteration in the new mosque,

only the Arabic verses from the Quran were added new, sculpted by Hindu artisans who did not know the
Arabic language and curved the endings of letters as they did with Sanskrit language carvings. Qutub Minar is
a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

<p>Later sightseeing of the Second Mughal Emperor Humayun's Tomb - its architecture may have influenced
the construction of the Taj Mahal in Agra. Emperor Humayun died just six months after winning the throne of
Delhi in 1556 CE. His widow, Hamida Bano Begum (a.k.a. Haji Begum) supervised its construction under
Mughal Emperor Akbar’s rule. Having recently returned from Persia and its architect, Mirak Mirza Ghiyath,
being a Persian, the monuments has elements of Persian and Hindu architecture blended in it. Many later
Mughal rulers are also buried in this mausoleum. Humayun’s Tomb is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>
<p>Proceed further for sightseeing of India Gate (the war memorial), Parliament House and Presidents House
(from outside) and for lunch at Gulati’s Restaurant in Khan Market nearby. The British decided in 1911 to move
their capital from Calcutta (now Kolkata) to Delhi. Edwin Landseer Lutyens and his friend Herbert Baker were
chosen for designing various buildings in the new capital. In 1914 the First World War started and continued
until 1918. During this period the new capital’s construction was halted. Finally after its construction completed,
the British capital was moved to New Delhi in 1931. India Gate was originally a monument to honor the fallen
Indian soldiers in World War I, but now honors Indian soldiers all subsequent wars.</p>
<p>
In the afternoon stop by the Red Fort for photography from outside - the massive sandstone fort built by Shah
Jahan on the banks of river Yamuna. The fifth Mughal Emperor Shahjahan moved his capital from Agra to
Delhi in 1636 and started the construction of the walled “Shahjahanabad” city with 14 gates. The most
important gates, Mori, Lahori, Ajmeri, Turkman, Kashmiri and Delhi Gates still exist along with remnants of the
wall. Within the city there were many monuments constructed but the most ambitious project was the Red Fort
– according to a horoscope done to determine the auspicious time for starting its construction, the work on
building the Red Fort started on May 12, 1639. In the Emperor’s Balcony in Diwan-i-Am or the Hall of Public
Audience, there are a set of marble panels that were made in Pietra Dure art by the Florentine jeweler, Austin
de Bordeaux. The most famous of these is the one depicting Orpheus playing the flute. There are many other
palaces in the fort that were decorated with inlay of semi-precious stones in marble. Red Fort is a UNESCO
World Heritage Site.

<p>
<strong>Jama Masjid -</strong> is the largest mosque in India and stands across the road from the Red Fort, built by Mughal
Emperor Shahjahan 1650-56 CE. It was originally called "Masjid-i-Jahannuma" or world reflecting mosque. Its
construction was supervised by Vazir Saadula Khan and its chief architect was Ustad Khalil. About 25,000
people can pray here at a time. Overnight stay in hotel in New Delhi.

<h3 class="headingtxt">Day 3 DELHI - AGRA (165 Kilometers or 103 miles in 2 hours) :</h3>
<p>After breakfast transfer to Agra on the Yamuna Expressway and on arriving stop at the Tomb of Itmad-ud-
Daulah. This is the mausoleum built under supervision of Empress Nurjahan for her parents, Mirza Ghiaz Beg
and Begum Asmat in 1628 CE almost 7 years after her father's death. Mirza Ghiaz Beg received the title of
Itmad-ud-Daulah or ‘Lord of Treasure of the Empire’ from Emperor Jahangir. Upon arrival check in to the hotel.
Lunch in Pinch of Spice Restaurant on Fatehabad Road.</p>

<p>In the afternoon sightseeing of Agra Fort. Emperor Akbar moved his capital to Agra from Delhi in 1558 but the
construction of the Agra Fort started in 1565. It was built on the ruins of an earlier fort named Badalgarh. The
first Mughal Emperor Babur had occupied this fort after his victory in the battle of Panipat in 1526 CE. His son,
second Mughal Emperor Humayun was crowned in the old fort of Badalgarh in 1530. With about 4000 laborers
and craftsmen toiling for 8 years the fort's construction was completed in 1573. The entire fort was built with

narrow flat brick masonry work and laminated with red sandstone from the stone quarry at Sikri village west of
Agra. According the Emperor Akbar's official biography written by his trusted friend, Abul Fazl, there were
about 5000 buildings in the fort. Some of these buildings were demolished to make way for white marble
palaces of Emperor Shahjahan, facing the Yamuna River, on the eastern side of the fort. Most of the buildings
in western side were converted in to soldier’s barracks by the British East India Company. The western part of
the fort is still occupied by Indian military. Emperor Akbar's style was greatly influenced by the architecture of
the states of Gujarat and Bengal. It is also very unique because it reflects Emperor Akbar's tolerant religious
philosophy. The best of example of his architecture is visible in the palace popularly called Jahangiri Mahal. In
1666 the great Maratha warrior, Shivaji met with Emperor Aurangzeb but the Mughal Emperor broke his
promise and arrested him. He managed to escape in a spectacular manner by hiding in fruit baskets for
distribution to poor. The Jat and Maratha ruler occupied Agra Fort in later years. Finally in 1803 the British East
India Company captured it and demolished most of its monuments, only about 30 monuments have survived in
the south-eastern side of the fort. In 1983 the Agra Fort was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Monument.</p>
<p>On the way to hotel wonder at the largest collection of Zerdozi Embroidery Art in India. This embossed
embroidery art is attributed to the Mughal Empress Nurjahan. It uses silver, gold and colored silk thread
embroidery on silk and velvet background and is one of the unique arts originating in Mughal period. Overnight
stay in hotel in Agra.</p>

<h3 class="headingtxt">Day 4 Agra :</h3>
<p>Wonder at the world famous Taj Mahal in the glow of morning sunlight.</p>
<p>
Ample time in the vast complex for photographing and viewing the intricate Pietra Dure (inlay of semi-precious

</p>
<p>
Prince Khurram (later Emperor Shahjahan) and his father Prince Salim met their favorite future queens in a
mock market called Meena Bazaar to celebrate the Persian new year festival of Nowroz in Agra Fort. Prince
Salim wanted to marry Mehr un Nissa Begum, the daughter of Mirza Ghiaz Beg but Emperor Akbar did not
want Shiya influence in the royal family so he asked Mirza Ghiaz Beg to marry his daughter to an Afghan
commander and had him posted in Bihar. Prince Khurram was third eldest and not initially in direct line of
succession. He was betrothed to Arjumand Bano Begum on April 5, 1607 but Prince Salim delayed his
marriage. After death of Emperor Akbar, Prince Salim ascended the throne with the title of Emperor Jahangir
and it was only in May 1610 that Mehr un Nissa, the widow of the Afghan commander finally agreed to marry
him. He honored her with the title of Nurjahan (light of the world) after his marriage. One year later on May 10,
1612, Prince Khurram was finally allowed to marry his beloved Arjumand Bano Begum, who was the niece of
Mehr un Nissa (her brother’s daughter and granddaughter of Mirza Ghiaz Beg). She received the title of

Begum Mumtaj Mahal after her marriage with the Mughal prince. Begum Mumtaj Mahal was 19 years when
they married. She was his constant companion and most trusted advisor. During their 19 years of marriage she
gave birth to 14 children of which only 3 daughters and 4 sons survived. The youngest son, Aurangzeb fought
a war of succession against his elder brothers. One after the other he won against all of them, had all the
brothers killed and then put his father, Emperor Shahjahan, under arrest in his own palaces in Agra Fort.
Queen Mumtaj Mahal died on June 17, 1631 while delivering her 14th child, a daughter, Gauhar Ara Begum,
who survived and lived in Shahjahanabad to a ripe age of 75 years.
</p>
<p>
The site of the Taj Mahal mausoleum was a palace of the Maharaja of Amber, Mirza Raja Jai Singh. The
Emperor asked him to give the palace back to him and gave him other properties in lieu. The queen was
temporarily buried in Burhanpur where she died in an army encampment. The body was transferred to Agra
and again temporarily buried in the northwest section of the garden of Taj Mahal where a red sandstone
enclosure still marks the site of her temporary burial. The Taj Mahal mausoleum was completed in 1648
according to an inscription on its main gate.
</p>
<p>
The tomb was built exclusively for Queen Mumtaj Mahal, so her grave stone is in the center of the grave
chamber. Emperor Shahjahan died on January 16, 1666 in Mussamam Burj Palace in Agra Fort. He was
buried by the queen’s side and his grave stone is the only architectural feature in this mausoleum that is not
symmetrical. Taj Mahal, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
</p>
<p>
After breakfast enjoy a demonstration of the art of Pietra Dure (inlay of semi-precious stones on marble
surface) at Agra's oldest emporium where the not for sale section has some artifacts with inlay work much
finer than the most intricate art work in the Taj Mahal itself and perhaps the world's best.
</p>
<p>
Subsequently visit Sikandara, the tomb of Emperor Akbar. Emperor Akbar started the construction of his
mausoleum in his own lifetime in 1604. The emperor's friend, Abul Fazl, describes it in Akbarnama, the official
and historical chronicle of Emperor Akbar's rule variously as Behistan and Behistabad or the abode in
paradise. The construction continued for a very long time even after Emperor Akbar's demise. Emperor
Jahangir was displeased with the slow construction and personally intervened to expedite it. Between 1612
and 1614, with the addition of its main gate that is more impressive than the simple mausoleum, the
construction finally completed. The motifs and decoration on the main gate suggest a Persian influence and
Empress Nur Jahan may have had a hand in its architecture.
</p>
<p>
After lunch at Pinch of Spice Restaurant in Sanjay Market in north Agra, drive to the Dayalbagh Temple which
is actually a memorial of the first Guru (Teacher) of the Dayalbagh religious organization. Sir Shiv Dayal Sahab
established this group in 1861. Its basic tenets are unity of God and its philosophy blends elements of
Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism and Islam. The construction of Dayalbagh Temple started in 1905 and
was finally completed in 2018. It is now open to public. It has some of the finest sculptural elements in white
and colored marble as well as very special Pietra Dure art work. After sightseeing return to hotel. Rest of
afternoon is free to relax. Overnight stay in hotel in Agra.

<h3 class="headingtxt">Day 5 AGRA - JAIPUR (232 Kilometers or 144 miles in 5 hours) :</h3>
<p>
After breakfast drive one hour to Fatehpur Sikri for sightseeing of Mughal Emperor Akbar’s deserted capital
and the tomb of Sufi saint Sheikh Salim Chistie in the courtyard of the grand mosque.
</p>
<p>
Emperor Akbar did not have a male heir to his throne for a long time. He came to the Sikri village to seek the
blessings of the Sufi saint, Sheikh Salim Chistie, who prophesied that Emperor Akbar would have three sons.
The emperor moved with his Hindu queen, Jodha Bai, to Sikri village to live with the saint and started building
an alternative capital at the site which was earlier a query for red sandstone. The entire capital was built with
red sandstone from the ridge on which it is located. The first born son was named Salim after the Sufi saint.
The second was named Murad or the longed one. The third son was named Daniel, probably influenced by the
Jesuit priests from Goa who were invited by the Emperor to teach him about Christianity. Emperor Akbar
developed the philosophy of “Sulah Qul” – living in harmony with all religions. Later he developed his own
religion, Din-i-Ilahi or faith of God. His dear friend and official biographer, Abul Fazl, was among the first to
convert to the new religion which he described in “Akbar Nama”.
</p>
<p>
Visit the grand Friday “Jama Masjid” and the mausoleum of Sheikh Salim Chistie, which was renovated using
the white marble by later Mughal Emperors. After Emperor Akbar moved away from this capital, living there
only 14 years, the capital was deserted for more than 400 years until Lord Curzon, British Viceroy of India
ordered the Archaeological Survey of India to restore this fascinating capital and this renovation work is still
going on. The palaces were all covered with wild forest and wild animals lived in the palaces. The “Dargah” or
mausoleum of the saint was never deserted and people from Agra and nearby villages have been coming
there to seek the saint’s blessings for centuries. Fatehpur Sikri is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
