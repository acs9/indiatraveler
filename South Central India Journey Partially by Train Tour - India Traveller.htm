Mani Bhavan was Gandhi's Mumbai headquarters for about 17 years, from 1917 to 1934 CE. The mansion belonged to
Revashankar Jagjeevan Jhaveri, Gandhiji's friend and host in Mumbai during this period. It was from Mani Bhavan that Gandhiji
initiated the Non-Cooperation, Satyagraha, Swadeshi, Khadi and Khilafat Movements. Gandhiji's association with the charkha

began in 1917 CE, while he was staying at Mani Bhavan. In his November 2010 visit, Barack Obama became the first high-
profile international visitor to visit the Mani Bhavan Gandhi Sangrahalaya in the last 50 years. Before him, only Martin Luther
King Jr. had visited Mani Bhavan in the 1950s; the Hanging Gardens, in Mumbai, also known as Pherozeshah Mehta Gardens,
are terraced gardens perched at the top of Malabar Hill, on its western side, just opposite the Kamala Nehru Park. They provide

<h3 class="headingtxt">Day 6: Daulatabad Fort and Ellora :</h3>
<p>
This morning, visit the Daulatabad Fort, towering 250 meters above the 
surrounding countryside on a volcanic lava rock. Its
three main walls use spike-studded doorways as ingenious defenses 
against elephant charges. The group of caves are
recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Site. The earliest caves (cave # 1 
to 12) are of Buddhist Mahayana origin and date from

6th to 8th centuries CE. The Brahmanical caves (# 13 to 29) including 
the giant monolithic Kailash Temple (# 16) date from 7th
to 10th centuries. The Jaina group of caves (caves 30 – 34) is 
exquisitely carved with fine, delicate sculptures, and includes fine
paintings dedicated to the Digambara sect. Through their art and 
architecture, the Ellora Caves serve as a window to ancient
India, including socio-cultural phenomena, material culture, politics, 
and lifestyles. Witness the rock-cut masterpiece, the Kailasa
Temple, a replica of the mountain abode of Siva: it measures an 
astounding 33 meters deep by 81 meters long and 47meters
wide, and the stonemasons removed three million cubic meters of rock to 
create it. On the way back to Aurangabad stop at Bibi-
ka Maqbara, an imitation of the Taj Mahal built as a mausoleum for 
Aurangzeb's queen. Later visit the austere and very simple
grave of the sixth Mughal Emperor Aurangabad in a Sufi enclave. 
Overnight in hotel.

<h3 class="headingtxt">Day 7: Full day excursion to Ajanta Caves :</h3>
<p>
Ajanta Caves are about 66.5 miles from Aurangabad. They were carved out 
of a steep rock side in a horseshoe shaped gorge
below which the Waghora River flows. Its source is just near the caves. 
At a vantage point that is now a popular viewing site, in
1819 CE, a group of British soldiers were wonderstruck by the few 
sections of the caves that were visible through the dense
foliage covering the entire façade of the Ajanta Caves. The Ajanta caves
 are exclusively Buddhist. There are altogether 29
caves of which the cave numbers 2, 3, 5, 8, 23 to 25 and 28 are 
unfinished. The numbers given to the caves are merely for
convenience and do not represent their chronological order. Some caves 
have sculptures whereas the others have wall
paintings also. These paintings cannot be designated as frescos 
technically as in the western painting style because the paint in
Ajanta and in other places in India was not applied on wet surface like 
in European frescos. These paintings originating from the
sixth and seventh centuries CE are much older than the paintings of the 
Renaissance Period in Europe. They represent the
same importance and significance in the history of Asian Art as the 
Renaissance Period paintings have for the history of
European Art. All Buddhist painting in South East Asia, Sri Lanka, 
Burma, China, Korea and Japan was inspired by the wall
paintings of Ajanta. The sculptures and paintings at Ajanta depict 
scenes from life of Sidhartha Gautam Buddha and from the
Jataka tales of Bodhisattvas or previous incarnations of Buddha. The 
Chaitya (prayer or meditation halls) cave numbers 9 and
10 as well as the Vihara (residential monasteries) cave numbers 12 and 
13 belong to the first phase dating from second century
BCE to the first century BCE. The Chaitya cave numbers 19, 26 and 29 as 
well as the Vihara cave numbers 1 to 7, 11, 14 to 18,
20 to 25, 27 and 28 are from the second phase dating from fifth century 
CE to sixth century CE. The unfinished caves mentioned
above could be from sixth and seventh century CE. The caves that have 
wall painted murals are mostly of Mahayana period
because the earlier paintings have eroded or faded.

<p>
In the early seventh century CE the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim and student, Hsuan T’sang visited the site of Ajanta caves and
was amazed to see the immensity and the aesthetic beauty of the works of sculpture and painting in these caves. The Buddhist
monks lived, carved gigantic caves into the granite surface of the mountain wall, meditated, prayed, sculpted and painted

beautiful scenes from the life of Buddha and his previous incarnations as they imagined after reading the Jataka tales.
Generation after generation of ascetic Buddhist monks worked for more than 900 years to create the wonder that Ajanta Caves
are today. The Ajanta Caves were declared UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. After sightseeing of the caves drive back
to Aurangabad. Once we arrive back in Aurangabad, you will board an overnight train to Hyderabad. Air-conditioned first-class
sleeper carriages are comfortable. Depart by Ajanta Express Train departing at 10.45 pm. In case of a small or larger group
participating in this tour, this journey will be with air-conditioned 2nd class sleeper coach because the AC 1st class has less
accommodation.

<h3 class="headingtxt">Day 8: Aurangabad – Hyderabad :</h3>
<p>
Arrive in the morning at MJF Malkajgiri Train Station in Hyderabad city 
at 8.28am. After welcome at the train station by our local
representative transfer to hotel. The train station is 8.7 miles from 
Fairfield by Marriott Hyderabad Hotel in Gachibowli area of the
city, it has the fifth largest economy in India. Hyderabad is the 
largest city in the Andhra Pradesh state and forth largest in
population in India with a city population of 6.9 million within the 
city limits and 9.7 million in the metropolitan area. Golcunda Fort
(round shaped fort) is located about 11 kilometers of 7 miles from 
Hyderabad city. The fort originally built by the Kakatiya
Dynasty (1163 to 1323 CE). Muhammad Quli Qutub Shah of the Qutb Shahi 
Dynasty established the city from the older
Golconda Fort to outside the fortified area in 1591 CE. With an eleven 
kilometers perimeter, 15- to 18-foot-high walls and about
70 ramparts and 8 huge gates, the fort appears nothing short of amazing.
 What makes the fort stand out is its system of
acoustics. The sounds of the claps made at the entrance of the fort can 
be clearly heard at the top of the hill. You can also see
two pavilions outside the fort built on rock namely, Taramathi Gana 
Mandir and the Premamathi Nritya Mandir, where the
legendary sisters, Taramathi and Premamathi resided. It is said that the
 two sisters performed (sang and danced) on a circular
shaped dais at the top of the structure, Kala Mandir. This could be 
visible from the king's court from the top of the fort. The other
highlight is a light and sound show which draws a lot of people. The 
legendary Bollywood actor, Amitabh Bachchan lent his voice
for the shows held here. The show which includes audio and visual 
effects can be watched in English, Hindi and Telegu
languages. The main gate being Fateh Darwaza which marked the victorious
 march of King Aurangzeb. The door is of 13 ft.
width and 25 ft. length and was built with steel spikes to protect it 
from elephants. The Balahisar Darwaza is yet another
magnificent structure. Its architecture is also the embodiment of Nawabi
 culture and style. The eastern gateway is the biggest
gate and the only entrance open to visitors now. Constructed on a hill, 
this intelligently planned architectural splendor has
excellent ventilation which used to be a huge respite during the summers
 for the royals. It is believed that there is an
underground tunnel which starts from Durbar Hall in the fort to the 
foothills. Bahmani Dynasty had ruled from Gulbarga from
1347 CE when Ismail Mukh rebelled against the Sultan Muhammad bin 
Tughlaq of Delhi and Daulatabad. He abdicated in favor
of Safar Khan who actually established the Bahmani Dynasty. The dynasty 
ruled from 1347 to 1425 CE from Gulbarga and from
1425 to 1527 CE from Bidar. They were followed by Qutub Shahi Dynasty 
that ruled from 1519 to 1591 CE from Golconda Fort.
They later expanded to build the city of Hyderabad from 1591 to 1687 CE.
 The Nizam title of the state and the rulers was an

abbreviation of Nizam ul Mulk, a title that was bestowed on Asaf Jah by 
the Mughal Emperor Farrukhsiyar (1713 to 1719 CE).
This dynasty went on to become the richest not only in India but later 
even the richest in the world, in large part due to revenues
from the diamond mines near the Golconda Fort. In the late morning 
explore the bustling bazaars and colorful Islamic
monuments of this energetic capital. In the morning head into the Old 
City and visit the Birla Temple and the Charminar or 'Four
Towers', built to celebrate the end of a plague in 1591. This 
magnificent cream square archway stands on four 56-meter-tall
towers near to the colossal black granite Mecca Masjid Mosque, the sixth
 largest mosque in India, which can accommodate up
to 10,000 worshippers. In the afternoon, visit the extensive ruins of 
the Golconda Fort, its citadel towering 120 meters above the
16 battlements. Intriguing elements to the fort include the excellent 
acoustics, hot and cold-water system, natural air conditioning
and Turkish Baths. Built by the Qutb Shahi dynasty, the fort was once 
considered impregnable and even its massive gates were
equipped with elephant proof spikes. Battles fought here were 
significant in the struggle between the Moghuls and Qutb Shahi
kings, who once dominated the area. You will also visit the nearby Qutb 
Shahi tombs. There are ten tombs in the area, all made
of black granite or greenstone and housed beneath an onion dome. The 
most impressive is that of King Muhammad Quli Qutb
Shah, the founder of Hyderabad who ruled until 1612 CE. Overnight in 
hotel in Hyderabad.

<h3 class="headingtxt">Day 9: Hyderabad – Bidar (by Road) :</h3>
<p>
After breakfast drive 142 kilometers of 88 miles in about 3 hours from 
Hyderabad to Bidar on a rather bumpy but leisurely ride.
On arrival, we'll visit Bidar's fort with its ruined palaces and tombs 
of the Bahamani Kings. Large parts of the fort are now in
ruins, but the walls remain giving us a good idea of how vast the place 
would have been. We'll walk through the formal gardens
before making a short stop at cannon point to see one of the larger 
bastions used to protect the city against invaders. Overnight
in hotel in Bidar.
</p>

<h3 class="headingtxt">Day 10: Bidar - Gulbarga – Bijapur (Vijayapura) by Road :</h3>
<p>
After breakfast drive about 116 kilometers or 72 miles in about 2 hours 
to the town of Gulbarga (aka Kalaburgi) in the
neighboring state of Karnataka that was established by the Bahmani 
Dynasty. This city is famous for its shrine of the Sufi saint,
Khwaja Banda Shah Nawaz but is also popular for its Hindu Sharana 
Basaveshwara Temple and the Buddha Vihar, a complex
built in 2007 having elements of Sanchi, Sarnath and Ajanta Buddhist 
sites. The tour of the city will include the Bala Hissar
Citadel, the beautiful domed Jami Masjid Mosque and the mausoleums of 
Bahmani Dynasty rulers. Later drive about 102 miles
in about 2 hours 45 minutes to Bijapur (now known by its ancient name of
 Vijayapura). Overnight in hotel in Vijayapura.

<h3 class="headingtxt">Day 11: Bijapur (Vijayapura) – Badami :</h3>
<p>
After breakfast you will visit the famous Gol Gumbaz. Gol Gumbaz is the 
most famous monument in Vijayapura. It is the tomb of
Mohammed Adil Shah (ruled 1627–1657). Some of his relatives are also 
buried in this grand mausoleum. It is the second largest
dome ever built, next in size only to St Peter’s Basilica in Rome. A 
particular attraction in this monument is the central chamber,
where every sound is echoed seven times. Another attraction at the Gol 
Gumbaz is the Whispering Gallery, where even minute
sounds can be heard clearly 37 meters away. Gol Gumbaz complex includes a
 mosque, a Naqqar Khana (a hall for the
trumpeters) (now it is used as museum) and the ruins of guest houses. In
 the surrounding ornamental gardens is an
archeological museum. Before leaving Bijapur, visit the Jami Masjid 
Mosque and stroll through the bustling daily market. The
journey then continues to Badami (119 kilometers or 74 miles in about 2 
hours by road). Overnight in hotel in Badami.

<h3 class="headingtxt">Day 12: Tour of Badami and drive to Hospet :</h3>
<p>
This morning, wake up in Badami. Once the capital of the Chalukyan, 
Badami is now a small village - with a busy bazaar -
nestled between sandstone hills. We'll take a short drive to the famous 
Cave Temples of Badami. A UNESCO World Heritage
Site, the temples were hewn out of solid rock as early as 550 CE and 
their interiors are lavishly adorned with reliefs and statues,
one even containing an 18-armed Shiva. Later this morning, we'll drive 
to Pattadakal, situated on the banks of the Malaprabha
River. Another World Heritage Site, its pink-tinged sandstone temples 
date back to the 7th century and represent a mixture of
South and North Indian temple styles, confirming its importance as a 
meeting point of both traditions. After a guided tour here,
we'll stop at the temples of Aihole. The sheer number of Aihole's 70 
temples brings to life the glories of the post-Gupta period
and reveals the genesis of Hindu medieval art (c.600 CE). Stopping to 
visit several of the temples, you will finally continue to our
destination for today, the town of Hospet, your base from which you 
will+ explore the astonishing archaeological site of Hampi.
Overnight in hotel in Hampi.
</p>
<h3 class="headingtxt">Day 13: Full day in Hampi :</h3>
<p>Granite, jagged rocks jutting out over a lunar landscape, belies the 
massive landscape of boulders that forms the view of Hampi,
an intriguing, ancient capital of a mighty south Indian empire. These 
gigantic monoliths that are eroded by natural elements over
eons of years define the backdrop of amazing Hindu religious and secular
 architecture of four dynasties starting with Sangama
Dynasty (1336-1485 CE through Saluva Dynasty (1485-1505 CE), Tuluva 
Dynasty (1505 – 1570 CE) to finally Aravidu Dynasty
from 1570 to 1646 CE. Even more defining are the region’s 1,600 
immaculately preserved 14th-to-16th century granite Hindu
temples, palaces, and markets with reliefs and art depicting gods and 
themes from ancient Hindu scriptures. Hampi is described
in Hindu scriptures as the monkey kingdom of Kishkinda, the region 
around the Tungabhadra River (then known as Pampa
Sarovara) near Hampi in present day Vijayanagara District, Karnataka. 
Lord Rama during his forced forest exile came to this
place in search of his abducted wife, Sita. You will be pointed to 
noteworthy episodes of Ramayana like the birthplace of monkey
god, Hanuman, an ardent disciple of Lord Rama and the very place where 
Lord Rama shot the arrow that killed the Raja Bali.
The fabulously rich princes of Vijayanagar Dynasty built Dravidian 
temples and palaces between the 14th and 16th centuries.
Conquered by the Deccan Muslim confederacy in 1565 CE, the city was 
pillaged over a period of six months before being
abandoned. The austere and grandiose site of Hampi comprise mainly the 
remnants of the capital city of Vijayanagara Empire
(14th-16th Cent CE), the last great Hindu Kingdom in southern India.</p>
<p>The property encompasses an area of 41 square kilometers or 16 square
 miles, located in the Tungabhadra basin in Central
Karnataka, Bellary District. The Krishna temple complex, Narasimha, 
Ganesa, Hemakuta group of temples, Achyutaraya temple
complex, Vitthala temple complex, Pattabhirama temple complex, Lotus 
Mahal complex are some of the most important
highlights of this amazing temple and secular architecture. Suburban 
townships (puras) surrounded the large Dravidian temple
complexes containing subsidiary shrines, bazaars, residential areas and 
tanks applying the unique hydraulic technologies and
skillfully and harmoniously integrating the town and military 
architecture with surrounding landscape. The remains unearthed in
the site delineate both the extent of the economic prosperity and 
political status that once existed indicating a highly developed
society. Suddenly destroyed in 1565 CE after the battle of Talikota, the
 ancient ruins are almost ethereal, a place of departed
spirits. Aim to visit the temples of Virupaksha and Vittala, with their 
remarkable sculptures, and amid the desolate and fantastic
boulder-heaped landscape and come upon the Queen's Bath and the richly 
carved King's Throne, the finely sculptured pillars of
the Ramachandra Swami Shrine, the vaulted Elephant Stables, the 
two-storied Lotus Pavilion, and the huge granite image of
Narasimha, one of Vishnu's incarnations. The city was reputedly the size
 of Rome at its peak, with a population of half a million

people. After sightseeing a short drive will bring you to the Hospet 
train station to board the HAMPI EXPRESS departing at 9.10
pm.</p>
<h3 class="headingtxt">Day 14: Bangalore :</h3>
<p>TArrive in Bangalore Train Station at 5.50 am. Transfer to day room 
in hotel in Bangalore. Half day sightseeing in Bangalore. After
farewell dinner transfer to Bangalore International Airport for flight 
returning to USA.</p>
