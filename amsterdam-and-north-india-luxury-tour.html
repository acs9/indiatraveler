<center><h2>FEEDBACK COMMENTS :</h2></center>
<p>“This was a 5-star Luxury trip on every level imaginable!  We stayed at the highest rated hotels in Northern India and dined on exquisite meals at the best restaurants in every city we traveled. My favorite hotel was the Lake Palace in Udaipur. We reached the oasis in a very small boat gliding to the palace. Our room had a view of the lovely lotus gardens within the walls of the palace. This highly customized tour consisted of just a handful of people, and we traveled in a sporty SUV that transported us to every city and event with ease. This was truly a once in a lifetime tour. Brij outdid himself on every detail of the trip. Thank you again for an amazing and wonderful trip; I can't believe we visited so many places!”</p>

<p>Now having returned to Fresno for almost three weeks, I still have a difficult time realizing that I have traveled to India and back. Thanks to you, our guide, it was an extraordinary experience. Every part of the trip was really fabulous! From the astronomical monuments, to the forts and palaces and our last day, the Haveli, India was similar to a dream. You did a superb job arranging the hotels and meals and I am grateful to you for all of your hard work as well as your compassionate leadership. I particularly appreciated all of your assistance with stairs and irregular foot paths. You were always there when I need some additional help (and even when I didn't). I really cannot wait to return and hope that it will be with you and Joan, once again! Thank you so much for a colossal experience in India.</p>

Soon after Muhammad Ghur was assassinated in Ghur and Qutubuddin Aibak proclaimed himself a sovereign monarch. He was originally a slave of Muhammad Ghur, who rose among the ranks of his army to become his favorite commander. Qutubuddin Aibak destroyed 20 Hindu and Jain temples to use their material to start the construction of Qutub Jami Mosque – oldest Islamic mosque in India. Many Islamic rulers of the Sultanate and later periods added to and repaired this minaret. An iron pillar in the courtyard that never rusts was originally the flag post of a Hindu Vishnu Temple built by Chandragupta II (375 to 417 CE). The Kufic Islamic calligraphy is unique in this mosque because it was sculpted in red sandstone by Hindu artisans under direction of Islamic scholars.
