<center><h2>FEEDBACK COMMENTS :</h2></center>
<p>This trip has been the best trip of my life and it is all because of the excellent service we have received from start to finish. Brijesh was my first point of contact and he worked tirelessly to create an itinerary based off of my desires to go white water rafting on the Ganges in Rishikesh and a hot air balloon ride. Not only did he spend a lot of time revising the schedule as | made changes but after it was all finalized and paid for, we had a member of our group that had to come later due to work. Brijesh was so gracious and easily made all the necessary changes to our itinerary. He kept me up to date on all the schedule changes, train rides, plane rides
and hotel recommendations. Highlights of my trip not only included the rafting and hot air balloon ride in Pushkar but the amazing temples in Khajuraho and an exquisite hotel in Gwalior (Taj Usha Kiran Palace Hotel) where | was wrapped in a beautiful Saree | had bought by a wonderful women at the hotel who had owned a Saree shop and | met the Head Chef who made a delicious meal for us. The hotel in Jaipur (Samode Haveli) was absolutely gorgeous and my personal favorite. | can’t wait to go back. Thank you Brijesh for all of your hard work and patience with me.</p>

Cynthia and Pat:</b> After breakfast drive on Raj Path Avenue where all the colonial era Indian government buildings are. Drive past Prime Minister's and Home Minister's (popularly called South & North Block, usually tourists like to stop at India Gate to take photographs which takes just a few minutes.

Subsequently drive to Moti Mahal in Daryaganj for lunch. Diwali celebration and dinner will be with an Indian family in New Delhi. Overnight in Vivanta by Taj Ambassador or Le Meridian

<p><b>Friday, October 20, 2017, New Delhi – Rishikesh / SHIVPURI (255 Kms, 5.5/6 Hrs drive)<br>
Cynthia and Pat:</b> After breakfast in the Vivanta by Taj Ambassador Hotel, check out to depart by air-conditioned Toyota Van for Rishkesh / Shivpuri. Between New Delhi and Rishikesh there are three towns (Meerat, Muzaffarnagar & Haridwar) and near these towns there are good restaurants. Dehradun is also near to the highway. The best restaurant is Grand Cheetal at National Highway 58, Khatauli, Muzaffarnagar. Driving time between New Delhi and Rishikesh is between 5 and 6 hours and you can stop at three restaurants if you want more stops; you can ask the driver to stop any scenic spot where you like to stop to just walk about a little.

Our Agra representative will meet you on the platform of the railway station and arrange transfer to Mughal Hotel (Room category: Mughal). Sightseeing in Agra includes 3rd Mughal Emperor Akbar’s Agra Fort. Emperor Akbar built this mighty fort on the ruins of Badalgarh, a fort initially built by Hindu king Badal Singh. The construction under Emperor Akbar started in 1575 CE and it was completed in 1573 with about 4000 masons and other construction labor working on the Red Sand Stone fort with about 500 palaces and buildings. Emperor Akbar’s grandson, Emperor Shahjahan demolished some of the palaces on the eastern side facing the Yamuna River and replaced them with grand, white marble ones. Emperor Shahjahan was kept as a prisoner in his own palaces in Agra Fort for the last 8 years of his life by his own son, Emperor Aurangzeb. The Red Sandstone Jahangiri Mahal is still in its original condition and displays the unique blend of Hindu, Jain, Buddhist and Islamic architecture. </p>

Her original name was Mehrunissa and was married to an Afghan commander of the Mughal Army, Sher Afgan, who died before Emperor Jahangir married her and gave her the title of Nurjahan, the light of the universe. She designed and supervised the construction of this mausoleum and this is evident in the feminine and Persian influences in its architectural decorations. It was built sometime after 1622 when Mirza Ghiaz Beg died. He was the grandfather of ArjumandBano Begum, for whom the Taj Mahal was built. </p>

Ample time to view and photograph the majestic southern courtyard, the grand main gate, the Charbagh (4-Quarter) gardens in front of the main white marble mausoleum of the Queen Mumtaj Mahal. ArjumandBano Begum was 14 years of age when she was married to Emperor Shahjahan. She became his favorite queen and was his most trusted advisor and constant companion, even in the camps at battlefields. She received the title of Begum Mumtaj Mahal, the crown of the palace, from her husband. She died in 1630 delivering his 14th child, a daughter, who was still born. Emperor Shahjahan chose a garden where the palace of the Maharaja of Jaipur stood earlier for the site of the mausoleum. The construction started in 1631 and was completed in 1648. </p>
<p>After breakfast drive to the deserted capital of Emperor Akbar, Fatehpur Sikri. Emperor Akbar did not have a male heir to the Mughal throne for a long time. He went to a Sufi saint, Sheikh Salim Chistie, who lived in the village of Sikri among the stone cutters who worked in the red sandstone quarry there. The saint correctly prophesied that the emperor would have 3 sons. Emperor Akbar moved with his pregnant queen, Jodha Bai, to live near the saint. When the son was born, he was named after the saint, Salim. He later took the title of Jahangir or conqueror of the world. Two other sons Murad and Daniel were later born in Fatehpur Sikri. When the emperor moved to this village soon more and more courtiers and common folk started moving to the new capital. Akbar took personal interest in the construction of the palaces and the mosque as described the Jesuit priest, Father Montserrat, who lived in Fatehpur Sikri and informed Emperor Akbar about Christianity. Emperor Akber later had to move to Lahore to quell uprisings in the north west and in Afghanistan. Soon the capital of Fatehpur Sikri was completely deserted. Thick forest engulfed the palaces and wild animals made their abode in the ruins of the palaces. In early 20th century, Viceroy Lord Curzon, instructed the Archaeological Survey of India to clean up the palaces part and start renovations. This restoration is still going on. Emperor Akbar’s tolerant religious philosophy is displayed in the blend of various architectural styles in FatehpurSikri, which is now a UNESCO World Heritage Monument.
