<center><h2>FEEDBACK COMMENTS :</h2></center>
<p>The trip was wonderful. India is an incredible country of contrasts with a fascinating history and culture. Kalinda and I really enjoyed the experience. The experience at Elefantastic was excellent. Rahul does a great job with the program. We both were happy that we changed our itinerary to include that experience. Thank you again for your help in putting this trip together.</p>

 <center><h2>North and South India Tour for Gaundez & Kalinda From April 13 To 28, 2013</h2></center>
 <h2 class="headingtxt2">ITINERARY :</h2>
 
 <p><b>Day 1, Saturday, April 13, 2013, DELHI:</b></p>
 <p>(Room Holding from 12th April night to allow early check in on 13th April morning). Arrive at Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi at 5 am. My representative will receive you at the airport and take you to your hotel. Relax in the morning. As requested no arrangements for picking Kalinda up at Railway Station in Delhi are made because she will be arriving in the evening. You could visit one or two of the city's museums:</p>
 <p><b>(1) Crafts Museum:</b> This museum celebrates living crafts of India. It was set up over a period of 30 years starting in the 1950s and 60s by the efforts of the renowned freedom fighter late SmtKamaladevi Chattopadhyay, when the area was envisaged as an ethnographic space where craftsmen from various parts of India would come in to work towards preservation of various traditional arts and crafts. By the 1980s it already had a substantial collection, and in time the museum space gradually evolved and transformed into its present shape. Today the museum holds over 35,000 rare and distinctive pieces reflecting the continuing tradition of Indian craftsmen through painting, embroidery, textiles, various crafts of clay, stone and wood, all housed in a building designed between 1975 and 1990 by architect Charles Correa,[1][3][4] incorporating traditional architectural vocabulary into a modern design.</p>
 <p><b>(2) National Museum:</b> This is a museum of Archaeology and Anthropology from 3000 BCE to Pre-British era. In the Buddhist section there is an original Urn containing the real ashes of Lord Buddha. </p>
 <p><b>(3) National Gallery of Modern Art:</b> This museum is located near India Gate in the heart of Delhi that was designed by the British architects Edwin Lutyens and James Baker as capital of India to replace Kolkata. </p>
 <p>Overnight in Blueberry Hotel in Karol Bagh (3-Star + category, about 3.5 miles northeast of India Gate)</p>
 <p><b>Day 2, Sunday, April 14, 2013, DELHI:</b> After breakfast drive to the Qutub Minar. This area was the capital of Chauhan Rajput rulers until the second battle of Taraori in 1192 when Prithvi Raj Chauhan was defeated by the Afghan ruler, Muhammad Ghur. The Afghan conqueror returned back to Ghur in Afghanistan after appointing the commander of his army, Qutubuddin Aibak as his governor in Delhi. Soon after Muhammad Ghur was assassinated in Ghur and Qutubuddin Aibak proclaimed himself a sovereign monarch. He was originally a slave of Muhammad Ghur, who rose among the ranks of his army to become his favorite commander. Qutubuddin Aibak destroyed 20 Hindu and Jain temples to use their material to start the construction of Qutub Jami Mosque – oldest Islamic mosque in India. Many Islamic rulers of the Sultanate and later periods added to and repaired this minaret. An iron pillar in the courtyard that never rusts was originally the flag post of a Hindu Vishnu Temple built by Chandragupta II (375 to 417 CE). The Kufic Islamic calligraphy is unique in this mosque because it was sculpted in red sandstone by Hindu artisans under direction of Islamic scholars. The artisans did not know Arabic language and made the endings of letters curved, as they used to do in Brahmi and Devnagri script of Sanskrit language. Later drive past the government buildings of India’s capital, planned & designed by the British architect, Edwin Lutyens and his friend Sir Herbert Baker: Office of Prime Minister, Office of Home Minister, President’s official residence, Parliament House and India Gate.</p>

Rightfully Emperor Akbar is referred to as ‘the Great’ in the world history. Through his tolerant and liberal policies towards his subjects who were mostly not Muslims, he created a vast and rich empire on the Indian sub-continent. Even in 21st. century the exceptionally successful business leaders are referred to as ‘Moguls’. (Lunch in a city restaurant: Shivakash is near the Taj Mahal). </p>

  <p><b>Day 4, Tuesday, April 16, 2013, AGRA – FATEHPUR SIKRI – ABHINERI VILLAGE NEAR DAUSA - JAIPUR:</b> After breakfast drive about an hour to Emperor Akbar’s deserted capital, Fatehpur Sikri – The capital of the Mughal Emperor Akbar from 1571 to 1584. Emperor Akbar went to a Sufi saint Sheikh Salim Chistie when he did not have a male heir to the throne. The saint correctly prophesied that the Emperor would have three sons. When his Hindu queen, Jodha Bai, became pregnant, the emperor moved with her to Sikri village to be near the saint. Gradually a whole new capital evolved with an exceptional and unprecedented blend of religious and secular architecture. The emperor invited Jesuit monks from Goa to teach him about the Christian religion. He also invited scholars of other religions to teach him. In the palaces and the mosque in Fatehpur Sikri one witnesses a blend of Hindu, Buddhist, Jain and Islamic architecture. After the demise of saint and perhaps because of many other reasons Emperor Akbar moved from Fatehpur Sikri. After being lived in for only 14 years the city was deserted for almost 400 years until the beginning of the 20th. century when Archaeological Survey of India started the renovation of the capital, which is still continuing.
