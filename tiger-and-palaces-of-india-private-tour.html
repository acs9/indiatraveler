<h3 class="headingtxt">Day 03, New Delhi:</h3>
<p>After breakfast sightseeing of Qutub Minar: its construction was initiated by Qutubudin-Aibak in 1198 CE upon becoming the first Sultan of Delhi.Qubub Uddin Aibak was born in Turkestan of ethnic Mamluk descent. This was a region where youth went out to neighboring countries and joined their armies as mercenaries. Often they were enslaved when the army they were fighting with lost. Qutubuddin was sold to the Qazi (Islamic judge) of Nishapur in Persia. There he became favorite of his master because of his skills of horseriding and archery among other warrior abilities. Qazi’s sons were jealous and they sold him after the Qazi’s death. Finally he ended up as slave of Sultan Muhammad of Ghur province of Afghanistan. He led Sultan of Ghur’s army in the 1st and 2nd battle of Tarain and was appointed Governor of Lalkot, the capital of the last Hindu Chauhan dynasty kingdom. When Muhammad of Ghur was assassinated, Qutubuddin bin Aibak declared himself sovereign monarch and started the construction of Qutub Jami Mosque (a.k.a. Quwwat ul Islam Mosque) and Qutub Minar. The construction of minaret did not complete in his lifetime and many later Islamic rulers of various successive dynasties left their mark on this monument, which is now 5 stories high and 73 meters or 240 feet tall. The mosque was constructed using architectural elements of 27 Hindu and Jain temples that were demolished to build it. Much of the decorative pillars and facades of walls in the mosque were used without alteration in the new mosque, only the Arabic verses from the Quran were added new, sculpted by Hindu artisans who did not know the Arabic language and curved the endings of letters as they did with Sanskrit language carvings. In the courtyard of the mosque there is an iron pillar dating from Gupta period (4th century CE) that was a flag post of a Hindu temple. It is made of such an iron alloy that it has not rusted after all these years being exposed to elements of nature. Qutub Minar is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>

<p>Later sightseeing of the Second Mughal Emperor Humayun's Tomb - its architecture may have influenced the construction of the Taj Mahal in Agra. Emperor Humayun died just six months after winning the throne of Delhi in 1556 CE. His widow, Hamida Bano Begum (a.k.a. Haji Begum) supervised its construction under Mughal Emperor Akbar’s rule. Having recently returned from Persia and its architect, Mirak Mirza Ghiyath, being a Persian, the monuments has elements of Persian and Hindu architecture blended in it.

The most important gates, Mori, Lahori, Ajmeri, Turkman, Kashmiri and Delhi Gates still exist along with remnants of the wall. Within the city there were many monuments constructed but the most ambitious project was the Red Fort – according to a horoscope done to determine the auspicious time for starting its construction, the work on building the Red Fort started on May 12, 1639. In the Emperor’s Balcony in Diwan-i-Am or the Hall of Public Audience, there are a set of marble panels that were made in Pietra Dure art by the Florentine jeweler, Austin de Bordeaux.

Fatehpur Sikri is now an Unesco World Heritage Site. The emperor lived in this capital for only 14 years to enjoy the company of the Sufi saint Sheikh Salim Chistie, who prophesied that Akbar would have three sons. The architecture of the city was planned to reflect the emperor's liberal views on different religions. The red sandstone for the capital's buildings was quarried from the hill on which it was built. The mausoleum of the Sufi saint is the only building in the capital that is made of white marble. It was also originally constructed with red sandstone but was later renovated using marble. The Sufi saint's tomb white marble and completely Hindu and Jain architecture, is located in the vast courtyard of the Jama Masjid.

Arjumand Bano Begum was the granddaughter of Mirza Ghiaz Beg, a Persian noblemen who migrated to Emperor Akbar's court in Fatehpur Sikri in 1578. Mirza Ghiaz's father, Muhammad Sharif Beg, served Shah Tahmasp Safavi of Persia at Khurasan, Yazd and Isfahan. Shah Tahmasp's son, Shah Ismail II, abandoned the liberal political and religious philosophy of his ancestors leaving poets, authors, painters and other liberal courtiers jobless. The origin of Safavids was in the liberal traditions of Sufism. Mirza Ghiaz and his son, Asaf Khan, after arriving in the Mughal court of Fatehpur Sikri from Persia, served Emperors Akbar and Jahangir. Mehrunnisa, the daughter of Mirza Ghias Beg, married the 4th. Mughal Emperor, Jahangir and was in later years virtually the empress of Mughal India under her title of Nur Jahan. Emperor Shahjahan as Prince Khurram married Arjumand, daughter of Asaf Khan and niece of Mehrunissa and honored her with the title of Begum Mumtaj Mahal or the crown of the palace.</p>
<img src="assets/images/tiger-and-palaces-tour/TAJ-MAHAL-tourist-walking-Brij.jpg" alt="" class="lazy"> <br><br>
<p>In her 18 years of marriage with the emperor, she was never apart from him, accompanying him even on battle field. She was his most trusted advisor. She bore 14 children of whom 4 sons and 3 daughters survived to adult age. The youngest son, Aurangzeb, killed his elder brothers in the battles of succession. Mumtaj Mahal died delivering her 14th. child at Burhanpur in central India in 1630, where they were camped outside a battlefield. Taj Mahal, the grandest mausoleum of the world took 17 years to complete in 1648.</p>
<p>After breakfast sightseeing of Agra Fort. Emperor Akbar moved his capital to Agra from Delhi in 1558 but the construction of the Agra Fort started in 1565. It was built on the ruins of an earlier fort named Badalgarh. The first Mughal Emperor Babur had occupied this fort after his victory in the battle of Panipat in 1526 CE. His son, second Mughal Emperor Humayun was crowned in the old fort of Badalgarh in 1530. With about 4000 laborers and craftsmen toiling for 8 years the fort's construction was completed in 1573. The entire fort was built with narrow flat brick masonry work and laminated with red sandstone from the stone quarry at Sikri village west of Agra. According the Emperor Akbar's official biography written by his trusted friend, Abul Fazl, there were about 5000 buildings in the fort. Some of these buildings were demolished to make way for white marble palaces of Emperor Shahjahan, facing the Yamuna River, on the eastern side of the fort. Most of the buildings in western side were converted in to soldier’s barracks by the British East India Company. The western part of the fort is still occupied by Indian military. Emperor Akbar's style was greatly influenced by the architecture of the states of Gujarat and Bengal. It is also very unique because it reflects Emperor Akbar's tolerant religious philosophy. The best of example of his architecture is visible in the palace popularly called Jahangiri Mahal. In 1666 the great Maratha warrior, Shivaji met with Emperor Aurangzeb but the Mughal Emperor broke his promise and arrested him. He managed to escape in a spectacular manner by hiding in fruit baskets for distribution to poor. The Jat and Maratha ruler occupied Agra Fort in later years. Finally in 1803 the British East India Company captured it and demolished most of its monuments, only about 30 monuments have survived in the south-eastern side of the fort. In 1983 the Agra Fort was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Monument.</p>

<p>Later drive across the Yamuna river to the tomb of “Itmad-ud-Daulah”. Mirza Ghiyas al Din Muhammad Beg was the father of Merh-un-Nisa, who later got the title of Begum Nur Jahan (the light of the universe). She was the 20th. and favorite queen of Emperor Jahangir and paternal aunt of Arjumand Bano, Begum Mumtaj Mahal for whom the Taj Mahal mausoleum was built. In later years of Emperor Jahangir's life, Nur Jahan, declared herself Empress of Mughal India and even had coins minted in her name. Mirza Ghiyas Beg passed away in 1622 followed shortly afterwards by his wife, Asmat Begum.</p>
<p>Nur Jahan personally designed a unique mausoleum for them on the eastern banks of River Yamuna in Agra. She envisioned the mausoleum on the model of a jewelry box. She was the first to use white marble for the entire main building of the tomb. Like all other contemporary Mughal buildings this mausoleum is also made of thin, baked bricks and mortar. The brick surfaces were then laminated with white marble in the interior and the exterior of the mausoleum. It was set in the middle of a Charbagh (a garden divided in 4 equal parts). In the east was the main entrance and on the west there was an entrance from the River Yamuna. In the north and south there were mock gateways for maintaining the symmetry. The mausoleum is very feminine and Persian in its style and decoration reflecting the origin of its architect, the Empress Nur Jahan. Overnight in hotel in Agra.</p>
